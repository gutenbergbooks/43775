<br />
<span class="s08">ITINERARY: UP THE MISSOURI AND OSAGE RIVERS, AND
THROUGH KANSAS TO THE PAWNEE VILLAGE ON THE
REPUBLICAN RIVER, JULY 15TH-SEPT. 30TH, 1806.</span></h2>

<p>Tuesday, July 15th, 1806. We sailed from the landing
at Belle Fontaine<a name="FNanchor_I-1" id="FNanchor_I-1" href="#Footnote_I-1" class="fnanchor">[I-1]</a> about 3 o'clock p. m., in two
boats. Our party consisted of two lieutenants, one surgeon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
one sergeant, two corporals, 16 privates and one interpreter.<a name="FNanchor_I-2" id="FNanchor_I-2" href="#Footnote_I-2" class="fnanchor">[I-2]</a>
We had also under our charge chiefs of the Osage and Pawnees,
who, with a number of women and children, had been
to Washington. These Indians had been redeemed from
captivity among the Potowatomies, and were now to be returned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
to their friends at the Osage towns. The whole
number of Indians amounted to 51.</p>

<p>We ascended the river about six miles, and encamped on
the south side behind an island. This day my boat swung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
around twice; once when we had a tow-rope on shore, which
it snapped off in an instant. The Indians did not encamp
with us at night. Distance six miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-3" id="FNanchor_I-3" href="#Footnote_I-3" class="fnanchor">[I-3]</a></p>

<p><i>July 16th.</i> We rejoined our red brethren at breakfast,
after which we again separated, and with very severe labor
arrived late in the evening opposite the village of St. Charles,<a name="FNanchor_I-4" id="FNanchor_I-4" href="#Footnote_I-4" class="fnanchor">[I-4]</a>
where the Indians joined us. Distance 15 miles.</p>

<p><i>July 17th.</i> We crossed the river to learn if any communications
had arrived from St. Louis, and if there was any
news of other Indian enemies of the Osages. Called at Mr.
James Morrison's, and was introduced to Mr. [George]
Henry, of New Jersey, about 28 years of age; he spoke a
little Spanish and French tolerably well; he wished to go
with me as a volunteer. From this place I wrote letters
back to Belle Fontaine, whilst the Indians were crossing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
river. A man by the name of Ramsay reported to the Indians
that 500 Sacs, Ioways, and Reynards were at the
mouth of Big Manitou [<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the band under Pashepaho
(Stabber) and Quashquame (Lance)]. This gave them
considerable uneasiness, and it took me some time to do
away the impression it made upon them, for I by no means
believed it. We were about sailing when my interpreter
[Vasquez] was arrested by the sheriff at the suit of Manuel
De Liza [or Lisa<a name="FNanchor_I-5" id="FNanchor_I-5" href="#Footnote_I-5" class="fnanchor">[I-5]</a>], for a debt between $300 and $400, and
was obliged to return to St. Louis. This made it necessary
for me to write another letter to the general.<a name="FNanchor_I-6" id="FNanchor_I-6" href="#Footnote_I-6" class="fnanchor">[I-6]</a> We encamped
about three-fourths of a mile above the village.</p>

<p><i>July 18th.</i> Lieutenant Wilkinson and Dr. Robinson went
with [one soldier and] the Indians across the country to the
village of La Charette.<a name="FNanchor_I-7" id="FNanchor_I-7" href="#Footnote_I-7" class="fnanchor">[I-7]</a> Mr. George Henry engaged, under
oath, to accompany me on my tour. Wrote to the general,
and inclosed him one of Henry's engagements.<a name="FNanchor_I-8" id="FNanchor_I-8" href="#Footnote_I-8" class="fnanchor">[I-8]</a> After we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
had made our little arrangements we marched by land and
joined the boats, which had sailed early [in charge of Sergeant
Ballenger], at twelve o'clock. Two of the men being
sick, I steered one boat and Mr. Henry the other, by which
means we were enabled to keep employed our full complement
of oars, although we put the sick men on shore. Encamped
on the north side. About eleven at night a tremendous
thunderstorm arose, and it continued to blow and rain,
with thunder and lightning, until day. Distance 15 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-9" id="FNanchor_I-9" href="#Footnote_I-9" class="fnanchor">[I-9]</a></p>

<p><i>July 19th.</i> In consequence of the rain we did not put off
until past nine o'clock; my sick men marched. I had
some reason to suspect that one of them [Kennerman<a name="FNanchor_I-10" id="FNanchor_I-10" href="#Footnote_I-10" class="fnanchor">[I-10]</a>] intended
never joining us again. At dinner time the sick
man of my own boat came on board; I then went on board
the other, and we continued to run races all day. Although
this boat had hitherto kept behind, yet I arrived at the encamping
ground with her nearly half an hour before the
other. The current not generally so strong as below. Distance
14 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-11" id="FNanchor_I-11" href="#Footnote_I-11" class="fnanchor">[I-11]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sunday, July 20th.</i> Embarked about sunrise. Wishing
to ascertain the temperature of the water, I discovered my
large thermometer to be missing, which probably had fallen
into the river. Passed one settlement on the north side,
and, after turning the point to the south, saw two more
houses on the south side. We encamped [on the south] in
a long reach which bore north and west. The absentees
had not yet joined us. Distance 15 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-12" id="FNanchor_I-12" href="#Footnote_I-12" class="fnanchor">[I-12]</a></p>

<p><i>July 21st.</i> It commenced raining near day, and continued
until four o'clock in the afternoon; the rain was immensely
heavy, with thunder and lightning remarkably severe. This
obliged me to lie by; for, if we proceeded with our boats,
it necessarily exposed our baggage much more than when
at rest, as the tarpaulin could then cover all. We set sail
at a quarter past four o'clock, and arrived at the village of La
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
Charette at a little after the dusk of the evening. Here we
found Lieutenant Wilkinson and Dr. Robinson with the
Indians; also, Baroney [Vasquez<a name="FNanchor_I-13" id="FNanchor_I-13" href="#Footnote_I-13" class="fnanchor">[I-13]</a>], our interpreter, with
letters from the general and our friends. The weather still
continued cloudy, with rain. We were received in the
house of Mr. Chartron, and every accommodation in his
power was offered us. Distance six miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-14" id="FNanchor_I-14" href="#Footnote_I-14" class="fnanchor">[I-14]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span></p>

<p><i>July 22d.</i> We arranged our boats, dried our lading, and
wrote letters for Belle Fontaine.</p>

<p><i>July 23d.</i> I dispatched an express to the general, with
advertisements relative to Kennerman, the soldier who had
deserted.<a name="FNanchor_I-15" id="FNanchor_I-15" href="#Footnote_I-15" class="fnanchor">[I-15]</a> We embarked after breakfast, and made good
progress. Lieutenant Wilkinson steered one boat and I
the other, in order to detach all the men on shore, with the
Indians, that we could spare. We crossed to the south
side, a little below Shepherd river. Dr. Robinson killed a
deer, which was the first killed by the party. Distance 13
miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-16" id="FNanchor_I-16" href="#Footnote_I-16" class="fnanchor">[I-16]</a></p>

<p><i>July 24th.</i> We embarked at half past six o'clock. Very
foggy. The Indians accompanied by only three of my
people. Lieutenant Wilkinson being a little indisposed, I
was obliged to let Baroney steer his boat. We made an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
excellent day's journey, and encamped [on the south] five
miles from [below] the Gasconade river. Killed three deer,
one bear, and three turkeys. But three or four of the Indians
arrived; the others encamped a small distance below.
Distance 18 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-17" id="FNanchor_I-17" href="#Footnote_I-17" class="fnanchor">[I-17]</a></p>

<p><i>July 25th.</i> We embarked at half past six o'clock, and arrived
at the entrance of the Gasconade river at half past
eight o'clock, at which place I determined to remain the day,
as my Indians and foot people were yet in the rear, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
had complained to me of being without shoes, leggings, etc.
Distance five miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-18" id="FNanchor_I-18" href="#Footnote_I-18" class="fnanchor">[I-18]</a></p>

<p>One of our Pawnees did not arrive until late; the other
had communicated his suspicions to me that the Oto, who
was in company, had killed him: he acknowledged that he
proposed to him to take out their baggage and return to
St. Louis. The real occasion of his absence, however, was
his having followed a large fresh trace up the Gasconade a
considerable distance; but finding it led from the Missouri,
he examined it and discovered horses to have been on it; he
then left it, joined ours, and came in. This being generally
the route taken by the Potowatamies, when they go to war
against the Osage, it occasioned some alarm. Every morning
we were awakened by the mourning of the savages, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
commenced crying about daylight, and continued for the
space of an hour. I made inquiry of my interpreter with
respect to this, who informed me that this was a custom not
only with those who had recently lost their relatives, but also
with others who recalled to mind the loss of some friend,
dead long since, and joined the other mourners purely from
sympathy. They appeared extremely affected; tears ran
down their cheeks, and they sobbed bitterly; but in a
moment they dry their cheeks and cease their cries. Their
songs of grief generally run thus: "My dear father exists
no longer; have pity on me, O Great Spirit! you see I cry
forever; dry my tears and give me comfort." The warriors'
songs are thus: "Our enemies have slain my father (or
mother); he is lost to me and his family; I pray to you, O
Master of Life! to preserve me until I avenge his death,
and then do with me as thou pleaseth."</p>

<p><i>July 26th.</i> We commenced at five o'clock to ferry the
Indians over the Gasconade, and left the entrance of this
river at half past six o'clock in the afternoon. Met five
Frenchmen, who informed us that they had just left the
Osage river, and that it was so low they could not ascend it
with their canoe. We wrote letters and sent them back by
them.<a name="FNanchor_I-19" id="FNanchor_I-19" href="#Footnote_I-19" class="fnanchor">[I-19]</a> Dr. Robinson, Baroney, Sparks, and all the Indians
encamped about one league above us. Killed one bear, two
deer, one otter, three turkeys, and one raccoon. Distance
15 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-20" id="FNanchor_I-20" href="#Footnote_I-20" class="fnanchor">[I-20]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sunday, July 27th.</i> We embarked at half past five o'clock,
and arrived at the Indians' camp at seven o'clock. They
had been alarmed the day before, and in the evening sent
men back in the trace, and some of the chiefs sat up all
night. Breakfasted with them. About half past three
o'clock encamped in sight of the Osage river. There being
every appearance of rain, we halted thus early in order to
give the Indians time to prepare temporary camps, and to
secure our baggage. I went out to hunt, and firing at a
deer, near two of the Indians who were in the woods, they
knew the difference of the report of my rifle from their guns,
were alarmed, and immediately retired to camp. Distance
13 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-21" id="FNanchor_I-21" href="#Footnote_I-21" class="fnanchor">[I-21]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span></p>

<p><i>July 28th.</i> Embarked at half past five o'clock, and at
half past ten arrived at the Osage<a name="FNanchor_I-22" id="FNanchor_I-22" href="#Footnote_I-22" class="fnanchor">[I-22]</a> river, where we stopped,
discharged our guns, bathed, etc. We then proceeded on
about six miles, where we waited for and crossed the Indians
to the west shore; we then proceeded on to the first island,
and encamped on the west side, Sans Oreille and only four
or five young men coming up, the rest encamping some distance
behind. Killed one deer and one turkey. Distance 19
miles.</p>

<p><i><a name="july29" id="july29">July 29th.</a></i> All the [rest of the] Indians arrived very early.
Big Soldier, whom I had appointed the officer to regulate
the march, was much displeased that Sans Oreille and the
others had left him, and said for that reason he would not
suffer any woman to go in the boat and by that means
separate the party; but in truth it was from jealousy of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
men whose women went in the boats. He began by flogging
one of the young men and was about to strike Sans
Oreille's wife, but was stopped by him and told that he
knew he had done wrong, but that the women were innocent.
We then crossed them and embarked at half past
eight o'clock. About twelve o'clock we found the Indians
rafting the river, when the first chief of the Little Osage,
called Tuttasuggy, or Wind, told me that the man whom
Big Soldier struck had not yet arrived with his wife, "but
that he would throw them away." As I knew he was
extremely mortified at the dissensions which appeared to
reign amongst them, I told him by no means [to do so];
that one of my boats should wait for the woman and her
child, but that the man might go to the devil, as a punishment
for his insubordination.</p>

<p>I then left Baroney with one boat, and proceeded with
the other. We were called ashore by three young Indians,
who had killed some deer; and, on putting them on board,
gave them about one or two gills of whisky, which intoxicated
all of them. It commenced raining about one o'clock,
and continued incessantly for three hours, which obliged us
to stop and encamp. One of our men, Miller, lost himself,
and did not arrive until after dark. Killed five deer, one
turkey, and one raccoon. Distance 14 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-23" id="FNanchor_I-23" href="#Footnote_I-23" class="fnanchor">[I-23]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span></p>

<p><i>July 30th.</i> After the fog dispersed I left Lieutenant Wilkinson
with the party to dry the baggage, and went with
Dr. Robinson and Bradley. About two o'clock we returned,
set sail, and having passed the first rapid about three miles,
encamped on the eastern shore. Killed three deer. Distance
five miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-24" id="FNanchor_I-24" href="#Footnote_I-24" class="fnanchor">[I-24]</a></p>

<p><i>July 31st.</i> We embarked early, and passed several rapids
pretty well. Dined with the Indians. Two of them left us
in the morning for the village, and they all had an idea of
doing the same, but finally concluded otherwise. One of the
Osages, who had left the party for the village, returned and
reported that he had seen and heard strange Indians in the
woods. This we considered as merely a pretext to come
back. I this day lost my dog, and the misfortune was the
greater, as we had no other dog which would bring anything
out of the water. This was the dog Fisher had presented
to me at Prairie des Chiens. Killed three deer and one
turkey. Distance 18 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-25" id="FNanchor_I-25" href="#Footnote_I-25" class="fnanchor">[I-25]</a></p>

<p><i>Aug. 1st.</i> It having rained all night, the river appeared
to have risen about six inches. We spread out our baggage
to dry, but it continuing to rain at intervals all day, the
things were wetter at sundown than in the morning. We
rolled them up and left them on the beach. We sent out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
two hunters in the morning, one of whom killed three deer;
all the Indians killed three more.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 2d.</i> The weather cleared up. The lading being
spread out to dry, Dr. Robinson, myself, Bradley, Sparks,
and Brown went out to hunt. We killed four deer, the Indians
two. Having reloaded the boats, we embarked at five
o'clock, and came about two miles. The river rose, in the
last 24 hours, four inches.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Aug. 3d.</i> Embarked early, and wishing to save
the fresh [take advantage of the rise in the river], I pushed
hard all day. Sparks was lost, and did not arrive until night.
We encamped about 25 paces from the river, on a sand-bar.
Near day I heard the sentry observe that the boats had better
be brought in; I got up and found the water within a
rod of our tent, and before we could get all our things out it
had reached the tent. Killed nine deer, one wildcat, one
goose, and one turkey. Distance 18 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-26" id="FNanchor_I-26" href="#Footnote_I-26" class="fnanchor">[I-26]</a></p>

<p><i>Aug. 4th.</i> We embarked early and continued on for some
time, not being able to find a suitable place to dry our
things, but at length stopped on the east shore. Here we
had to ferry the Indians over a small channel which we did
not before observe; all of them, however, not arriving, we
put off and continued our route. Finding our progress
much impeded by our mast, I unshipped it and stripped it
of its iron, and, after Lieutenant Wilkinson had carved our
names on it, set it adrift, followed by the yards. This mast
had been cut and made at [our wintering post on] Pine
creek, Upper Mississippi. After proceeding some miles, we
found the Indians on the west shore, they having rafted the
river. We stopped for them to cook, after which we proceeded.
The navigation had become very difficult from the
rapidity of the current, occasioned by the rise of the water,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
which rose one foot in an hour. Killed two deer. Rainy.
Distance 10 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-27" id="FNanchor_I-27" href="#Footnote_I-27" class="fnanchor">[I-27]</a></p>

<p><i>Aug. 5th.</i> We lay by this day, in order to give the Indians
an opportunity to dry their baggage. Dr. Robinson and
myself, accompanied by Mr. Henry, went out to hunt; we
lost the latter about two miles from camp. After hunting
some time on the west shore, we concluded to raft the river,
which we effected with difficulty and danger, and hunted for
some time, but without success. We then returned to the
party and found that Mr. Henry, who had been lost, had
arrived one hour before us; he had met one of the soldiers,
who brought him in.</p>

<p>To-day in our tour I passed over a remarkably large rattlesnake,
as he lay curled up, and trod so near him as to
touch him with my foot, he drawing himself up to make
room for my heel. Dr. Robinson, who followed me, was on
the point of treading on him, but by a spring avoided it. I
then turned round and touched him with my ramrod, but he
showed no disposition to bite, and appeared quite peaceable.
The gratitude which I felt toward him for not having
bitten me induced me to save his life. Killed four deer.
River rises 13 inches. Rain continues.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 6th.</i> We embarked at half past eight o'clock, it
having cleared off and had the appearance of a fine day.
Passed [Little] Gravel river [of Pike, now Big Gravois creek]
on the west.<a name="FNanchor_I-28" id="FNanchor_I-28" href="#Footnote_I-28" class="fnanchor">[I-28]</a> About three miles above this river the Indians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
left us and informed me that, by keeping a little to the
south and west, they would make in 15 miles what would be
at least 35 miles for us. Dr. Robinson, Mr. Henry, and Sergeant
Ballenger accompanied them. Killed two deer. Distance
13 miles.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 7th.</i> Not being detained by the Indians, we are for
once enabled to embark at a quarter past five o'clock. The
river having fallen since yesterday morning about four feet,
we wish to improve every moment of time previous to its
entire fall. We proceeded extremely well, passed the Saline
[read Great Gravel<a name="FNanchor_I-29" id="FNanchor_I-29" href="#Footnote_I-29" class="fnanchor">[I-29]</a>] river [of Pike, now Grand Auglaise
creek] on the east, and encamped opposite La Belle Roche
on the west shore. This day we passed many beautiful
cliffs on both sides of the river; saw a bear and wolf swimming
the river. I employed myself part of the day in translating
into French a talk of General Wilkinson's to Cheveux
Blanche.<a name="FNanchor_I-30" id="FNanchor_I-30" href="#Footnote_I-30" class="fnanchor">[I-30]</a> Distance 21 miles.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span></p>

<p><i>Aug. 8th.</i> We embarked at 20 minutes past five o'clock.
Found the river had fallen about two feet during the night.
At the confluence of the Youngar<a name="FNanchor_I-31" id="FNanchor_I-31" href="#Footnote_I-31" class="fnanchor">[I-31]</a> with the Osage river we
breakfasted. Encamped at night on a bar. Distance 21
miles.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 9th.</i> We embarked at five o'clock, and at half past
six met the Indians and our gentlemen. They had met
with nothing extraordinary. They had killed in their excursion
seven deer and three bear. We proceeded to an old
wintering ground, where there were eight houses, occupied
last winter by [Blank], who had not been able to proceed any
higher for want of water. Passed the Old Man's Rapids,
below which, on the west shore, are some beautiful cliffs.
Dined with the Indians, after which we passed Upper Gravel
river on the west, and Pottoe [qu. Poteau?] river on the
east. Sparks went out to hunt, and did not arrive at our
encampment, nor did the Indians. Distance 25 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-32" id="FNanchor_I-32" href="#Footnote_I-32" class="fnanchor">[I-32]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Aug. 10th.</i> Embarked a quarter past five o'clock,
when the sun shone out very clearly; but in 15 minutes it
began to rain, and continued to rain very hard until one
o'clock. Passed the Indians, who were encamped on the
west shore, about half a mile, and halted for them. They
all forded the river but Sans Oreille, who brought his wife
up to the boats, and informed me that Sparks had encamped
with them, but left them early to return in search
of us. We proceeded after breakfast. Sparks arrived just
at the moment we were embarking. The Indians traversing
the country on the east had sent Sparks with Sans Oreille.
About two o'clock split a plank in the bottom of the
batteau. Unloaded and turned her up, repaired the
breach, and continued on the route. By four o'clock found
the Indians behind a large island; we made no stop, and
they followed us. We encamped together on a bar, where
we proposed halting to dry our corn, etc., on Monday.
Killed four deer. Distance 18½ miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-33" id="FNanchor_I-33" href="#Footnote_I-33" class="fnanchor">[I-33]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span></p>

<p><i>Aug. 11th.</i> We continued here to dry our corn and
baggage. This morning we had a match at shooting. The
prize offered to the successful person was a jacket and
a twist of tobacco, which I myself was so fortunate as to
win; I made the articles, however, a present to the young
fellow who waited on me. After this, taking Huddleston
with me, I went out to hunt; after traveling about 12 miles
we arrived at the river, almost exhausted with thirst. I
here indulged myself by drinking plentifully of the water,
and was rendered so extremely unwell by it that I was
scarcely capable of pursuing my route to the camp. On
arriving opposite it, I swam the river, from which I experienced
considerable relief. The party informed me
they had found the heat very oppressive, and the mercury,
at sundown, was at 25° Reaumer [Réaumur]. This day,
for the first time, I saw trout west of the Allegheny mountains.
Reloaded our boats and finished two new oars,
which were requisite.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 12th.</i> Previously to our embarkation, which took
place at half past five o'clock, I was obliged to convince my
red brethren that, if I protected them, I would not suffer
them to plunder my men with impunity; for the chief had
got one of my lads' tin cups attached to his baggage, and,
notwithstanding it was marked with the initials of the
soldier's name, he refused to give it up. On which I
requested the interpreter to tell him, "that I had no idea
that he had purloined the cup, but supposed some other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
person had attached it to his baggage; but that, knowing
it to be my soldier's, I requested him to deliver it up, or
I should be obliged to take other measures to obtain it."
This had the desired effect; for I certainly should have put
my threats into execution, from this principle, formed from
my experience during my intercourse with Indians, that if
you have justice on your side, and do not enforce it, they
universally despise you. When we stopped for dinner, one
of my men took his gun and went out; not having returned
when we were ready to re-embark, I left him. Passed the
Indians twice when they were crossing the river. Passed
some very beautiful cliffs on the W. [N. or right] shore;
also Vermillion [Little Tabeau] and Grand rivers, the
latter of which is a large stream, and encamped at the
[first bend above it, on the E. or left-hand bank of the
Osage<a name="FNanchor_I-34" id="FNanchor_I-34" href="#Footnote_I-34" class="fnanchor">[I-34]</a>]. Distance 24 miles.</p>

<p>Immediately after our encampment a thunder-storm came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
on, which blew overboard my flag-staff and a number of
articles of my clothing, which were on top of the cabin, and
sunk them immediately. Being much fatigued and the
bank difficult of ascent, lay down in the cabin without
supper and slept all night. It continued to rain. The man
[Sparks] I left on shore arrived on the opposite bank in the
night, having killed two deer, but was obliged to leave the
largest behind. Finding he was not to be sent for, he concealed
his gun and deer, and swam the river.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 13th.</i> It continued to rain. In the morning sent
a boat over for Sparks' gun and deer. Embarked at half
past nine o'clock. Stopped to dine at two o'clock. During
the time we halted, the river rose over the flat bar on which
we were; this, if we had no other proof, would convince us
we were near the head of the river, as the rain must have
reached it. We made almost a perfect circle, so that I do
not believe we were to-night three miles from where we
encamped last night. This day, for the first time, we have
prairie hills. Distance 13 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-35" id="FNanchor_I-35" href="#Footnote_I-35" class="fnanchor">[I-35]</a></p>

<p><i><a name="aug14" id="aug14">Aug. 14th</a>.</i> Embarked at half past five o'clock. Passed
the Park, which is 10 miles around, and not more than three-quarters
of a mile across, bearing from S. 5° E. to due N.
At its head we breakfasted, and just as we were about to
put off we saw and brought-to a canoe manned with three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
engagees of Mr. [Chouteau], who informed us that the Little
Osage had marched a war-party against the Kans, and the
Grand Osage a party against our citizens on the Arkansaw
river. Wrote by them to the general<a name="FNanchor_I-36" id="FNanchor_I-36" href="#Footnote_I-36" class="fnanchor">[I-36]</a> and all friends.
Gave the poor fellows some whisky and eight quarts of
corn, they having had only two turkeys for four days. We
left them and proceeded, passing on our east some of the
largest cedars I ever saw. Came on very well in the afternoon,
and encamped<a name="FNanchor_I-37" id="FNanchor_I-37" href="#Footnote_I-37" class="fnanchor">[I-37]</a> on an island above Turkey island.
Distance 28 miles.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 15th.</i> We embarked at five o'clock, and at eight
o'clock met the Indians and the gentlemen<a name="FNanchor_I-38" id="FNanchor_I-38" href="#Footnote_I-38" class="fnanchor">[I-38]</a> who accompanied
them. Found all well. They had been joined by their
friends and relatives from the village, with horses to transport
their baggage. Lieutenant Wilkinson informed me that
their meeting was very tender and affectionate&mdash;"wives
throwing themselves into the arms of their husbands, parents
embracing their children, and children their parents,
brothers and sisters meeting, one from captivity, the other
from the towns; they at the same time returning thanks to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
the Good God for having brought them once more together"&mdash;in
short, the <i>tout ensemble</i> was such as to make
polished society blush, when compared with those savages,
in whom the passions of the mind, whether joy, grief, fear,
anger, or revenge, have their full scope. Why can we not
correct the baneful passions, without weakening the good?
Sans Oreille made them a speech, in which he remarked:
"Osage, you now see your wives, your brothers, your
daughters, your sons, redeemed from captivity. Who did
this? Was it the Spaniards? No. The French? No.
Had either of those people been governors of the country,
your relatives might have rotted in captivity, and you never
would have seen them; but the Americans stretched forth
their hands, and they are returned to you! What can you
do in return for all this goodness? Nothing; all your
lives would not suffice to repay their goodness." This man
had children in captivity, not one of whom we were able to
obtain for him.</p>

<p>The chief then requested that Lieutenant Wilkinson and
Dr. Robinson might be permitted to accompany them by
land, to which I consented. Wrote a letter to Cheveux
Blanche, by Lieutenant Wilkinson. When we parted, after
delivering the Indians their baggage, Sans Oreille put an
Indian on board to hunt, or obey any other commands I
might have for him. We stopped at eleven o'clock to dry our
baggage. Found our biscuit and crackers almost all ruined.
Put off at half past four o'clock, and encamped at three-quarters
past five o'clock. Distance 15½ miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-39" id="FNanchor_I-39" href="#Footnote_I-39" class="fnanchor">[I-39]</a></p>

<p><i>Aug. 16th.</i> We embarked at five o'clock and came on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
extremely well in the barge to an evacuated French hunting-camp
12 miles to breakfast, the batteaux coming up
late. We exchanged hands. About twelve o'clock passed
the Grand Fork [confluence of Sac river with the Osage,
above Osceola], which is equal in size to the one on which
we pursued our route. Waited to dine at the rocks called
the Swallow's Nest, on the W. shore, above the forks. The
batteaux having gained nearly half an hour, the crews are
convinced that it is not the boat, but men who make the
difference; each take their own boat, after which we proceeded
very well, the water being good and men in spirits.
Saw an elk on the shore; also met an old man alone hunting,
from whom we obtained no information of consequence.
Encamped on the W. shore of Mine [or Mire]
river. Distance 37 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-40" id="FNanchor_I-40" href="#Footnote_I-40" class="fnanchor">[I-40]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span></p>

<p>We to-day passed the place where the chief called Belle
Oiseau, and others, were killed. The Belle Oiseau was
killed by the Sacs in the year 1804, in a boat of Manuel de
Liza, when on his way down to St. Louis, in order to join
the first deputation of his nation who were forwarded to the
seat of government by Governor Lewis. A particular relation
of the event, no doubt, has been given by that gentleman.
This chief had a son who accompanied me to the
Pawnee nation, and whose honorable deportment, attachment
to our government, amiableness of disposition, and
the respect and esteem in which he was held by his compeers,
entitle him to the attention of our agents to his
nation.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Aug. 17th.</i> We embarked at five o'clock and
came 12 miles to breakfast. At four o'clock arrived at 10
French houses on the E. shore, where was then residing
a Sac, who was married to an Osage femme and spoke
French only. We afterward passed the position where Mr.
[Pierre] Chouteau formerly had his fort [Fort Carondelet<a name="FNanchor_I-41" id="FNanchor_I-41" href="#Footnote_I-41" class="fnanchor">[I-41]</a>],
not a vestige of which was remaining, the spot being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
only marked by the superior growth of vegetation. Here
the river-bank is one solid bed of stone-coal, just below
which is a very shoal and rapid ripple [Kaw rapids, where
was Collen or Colly ford]; whence to the village of the Grand
Osage is nine miles across a large prairie. We came about
two miles above [Chouteau's], and encamped on the W.
[right-hand] shore. This day the river has been generally
bounded by prairies on both sides. Distance 41½ miles.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 18th.</i> We put off at half past five o'clock. Stopped
at nine o'clock to breakfast. Passed the second fork<a name="FNanchor_I-42" id="FNanchor_I-42" href="#Footnote_I-42" class="fnanchor">[I-42]</a> of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
the river at twelve o'clock, the right-hand fork bearing N.,
about 30 yards wide; the left, the one which we pursued,
N. 60° W., and not more than 50 or 60 feet in width, very
full of old trees, etc., but with plenty of water. Observed the
road where the chiefs and Lieutenant Wilkinson crossed.
We proceeded until one o'clock, when we were halted by
a large drift quite across the river. Dispatched Baroney to
the village of the Grand Osage, to procure horses to take
our baggage nearer to the towns, and unloaded our boats.
In about two hours Lieutenant Wilkinson, with Tuttasuggy,
arrived at our camp, the former of whom presented me an
express from the general<a name="FNanchor_I-43" id="FNanchor_I-43" href="#Footnote_I-43" class="fnanchor">[I-43]</a> and letters from my friends.
The chiefs remained at our camp all night. I was attacked
by a violent headache. It commenced raining, and continued
with great force until day. Distance 19¼ miles.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 19th.</i> We commenced very early to arrange our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
baggage, but had not finished at one o'clock, when the chief
of the Grand Osage, and 40 or 50 men of his village,
arrived with horses. We loaded and took our departure for
the place where Manuel de Liza had his establishment,
[near Fort Carondelet], at which we arrived about four
o'clock, and commenced pitching our encampment near the
edge of the prairie, when I was informed that three men
had arrived from St. Louis sent by Manuel de Liza. I dispatched
Lieutenant Wilkinson to the village with Baroney,
who brought to camp the man [Jean Baptiste Duchouquette]
who had charge of the others from St. Louis; he
having no passport, I detained him until further consideration.
Our reception by the Osage was flattering, and
particularly by White Hair and our fellow-travelers. This
evening there arrived in the village of the Grand Osage an
express from the Arkansaw, who brought the news that a
boat, ascending that river, had been fired on, had two white
men killed and two wounded, and that the brother-in-law
of Cheveux Blanche, who happened to be on board, was
also killed. This put the whole village in mourning.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 20th.</i> About twelve o'clock I dispatched Baroney
for the chiefs of the Grand [Osage] village, in order to give
the general's parole to Cheveux Blanche; also, a young man
to the village of the Little Osage. Cheveux Blanche and
his people arrived about three o'clock, and after waiting
some time for Wind and his people, I just informed the
chiefs that I had merely assembled them to deliver the
parole of the general and present the marks of distinction
intended for Cheveux Blanche and his son&mdash;hanging a grand
medal round the neck of the latter. The packets committed
to my charge for the relations of the deceased Osages were
then delivered to them, the widow making the distribution.
It must be remarked that I had merely requested Cheveux
Blanche to come with his son, and receive the general's
message; but instead of coming with a few chiefs, he was
accompanied by 186 men, to all of whom we were obliged to
give something to drink. When the council was over we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
mounted our horses, rode to the village, and halted at the
quarters of the chief, where we were regaled with boiled
pumpkins; then we went to two different houses, and were
invited to many others, but declined, promising that I
would pay them a visit previous to my departure, and spend
the whole day. We then returned to camp. After inquiring
of White Hair if the men of Manuel de Liza had any
ostensible object in view, he informed me that they had
only said to him that they expected Manuel would be up to
trade in the autumn. I concluded to take the deposition of
Babtiste Larme as to the manner in which he was employed
by Manuel de Liza, forward the same to Dr. Brown<a name="FNanchor_I-44" id="FNanchor_I-44" href="#Footnote_I-44" class="fnanchor">[I-44]</a> and
the attorney-general of Louisiana, and permit the men to
return to St. Louis, as it was impossible for me to detach a
party with them as prisoners.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 21st.</i> In the morning White Hair paid us a visit,
and brought us a present of corn, meat, and grease; we
invited him, his son, and son-in-law to breakfast with us,
and gave his companions something to eat. I then wrote a
number of letters to send by express, and inclosed the
deposition of Larme. In the afternoon we rode to the
village of the Little Osage, and were received by our fellow-travelers
with true hospitality. Returned in the evening,
when a tremendous storm of rain, thunder, and lightning
commenced, and continued with extraordinary violence until
half past nine o'clock. It was with great difficulty we were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
enabled to keep our tents from blowing down. The place
prepared for an observatory was carried away.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 22d.</i> Preparing in the morning for the council, and
committing to paper the heads of the subject on which I
intended to speak. The chiefs of the Little Osage arrived
about one o'clock, also the interpreter of the Grand Osage,
who pretended to say that the Grand Osage had expected
us at their village with the Little Osage. Cheveux Blanche
arrived with his chiefs. The ceremony of the council being
arranged, I delivered them the general's parole, forwarded
by express. My reason for not delivering it until this time
was in order to have the two villages together, as it was
equally interesting to both. After this I explained at large
the will, wishes, and advice of their Great Father, and the
mode which I conceived most applicable to carry them into
effect. Cheveux Blanche replied in a few words, and promised
to give me a full reply to-morrow. Wind replied to the
same amount; after which Cheveux Blanche addressed himself
to Wind as follows: "I am shocked at your conduct,
Tuttasuggy&mdash;you who have lately come from the States,
and should have been wise; but you led the redeemed captives,
with an officer of the United States, to your village,
instead of bringing them through my town in the first
instance." To this Wind made no reply, but left his seat
shortly after, under pretense of giving some orders to his
young men. I conceived this reprimand intended barely to
show us the superiority of the one and inferiority of the
other; it originated, in my opinion, from an altercation of
Lieutenant Wilkinson and Cheveux Blanche, in which allusions
were made by the former to the friendly conduct of
the Little Chief, alias Wind, when compared to that of the
latter. I must here observe that when the chiefs and prisoners
left me, accompanied by Lieutenant Wilkinson, I did
not know the geographical situation of the two villages,<a name="FNanchor_I-45" id="FNanchor_I-45" href="#Footnote_I-45" class="fnanchor">[I-45]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
but conceived that, in going to the Little Village, they
would pass by the Grand Village, and of course that Lieutenant
Wilkinson and the chief would arrange the affair
properly.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 23d.</i> I expected to have received from the chiefs
their answers to my demands; but received an express from
both villages, informing me that they wished to put them off
until to-morrow. I then adjusted my instruments. Took
equal altitudes and a meridional altitude of the sun; but,
owing to flying clouds, missed the immersions of Jupiter's
satellites.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Aug. 24th.</i> Was nearly half the day in adjusting
the line of collimation in the telescopic sights of my theodolite.
It began to cloud before evening, and although the
sky was not entirely covered, I was so unfortunate as to miss
the time of an immersion, and, although clear in the intermediate
period, an emersion also. I was informed by Baroney
that the Little Village had made up 11 horses for us. In
the evening, however, the interpreter, accompanied by the
son-in-law and son of Cheveux Blanche, came to camp, and
informed me that there were no horses to be got in the village
of the Big Osage.</p>

<p>The son-in-law spoke as follows: "I am come to give you
the news of our village, which is unfortunate for us, our
chief having assembled his young men and warriors and proposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
to them to furnish horses, etc. They have generally
refused him; but I, who am the principal man after Cheveux
Blanche, will accompany you." The son: "Our young
men and warriors will not take pity on my father, nor on
me, nor on you, and have refused to comply with your request;
but I will accompany you with two horses to carry
provision for your voyage." The interpreter: "The Cheveux
Blanche was ashamed to bring you this answer, but
will again assemble his village and to-morrow come and give
you the answer." I replied: "That I had made the demand
without explanation, merely to let the Osage act agreeably
to their inclination, in order that we might see what disposition
they would exhibit toward us; but why do I ask of
their chiefs to follow me to the Pawnees? Is it for our
good, or their own? Is it not to make peace with the Kans?
To put their wives and children out of danger? As to their
horses which they may furnish us with, I will pay them for
their hire; but it is uncertain whether I can pay them here,
or give them an order on the Superintendent of Indian
Affairs at St. Louis; but this I do not now wish them to be
made acquainted with."</p>

<p><i>Aug. 25th.</i> In the morning we were visited by Cheveux
Blanche and three or four of his chiefs, who were pleased to
accord to my demands. He found much difficulty in informing
me that in all his village he could only raise four horses,
but that we should be accompanied by his son and son-in-law.
I then expressed to him the difference of our expectations
from the reality. He remained until after twelve
o'clock, when I went to the Little Osage village, and was
received with great friendship by the chief. Remained all
night at the house of Tuttasuggy. Took the census.<a name="FNanchor_I-46" id="FNanchor_I-46" href="#Footnote_I-46" class="fnanchor">[I-46]</a></p>

<p><i>Aug. 26th.</i> Rose early and found my friends in council,
which was merely relative to our horses. The chief then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
declared their determination to me, and that he himself
gave me one horse, and lent me eight more to carry our baggage
to the Pawnees. Sold the old batteau for $100 in
merchandise, which I conceived infinitely preferable to leaving
her to the uncertain safeguard of the Indians. About
this time we received the news that the party of Potowatomies
were discovered to be near the towns. I gave them
the best advice I was capable of giving, and then returned
to our camp.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 27th.</i> Spent in arranging our baggage for the
horses. Received four horses from the Little Village and
two from the Big Village. In the evening Lieutenant Wilkinson
rode to the Grand Village. I observed two immersions
of Jupiter's satellites.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 28th.</i> Writing to the secretary at war and the general,
and making arrangements for our departure. Visited
by Wind and Sans Oreille.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 29th.</i> Forenoon writing letters. In the afternoon
Dr. Robinson and myself went to the Grand Village, at
which we saw the great medicine dance. Remained at the
village all night.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 30th.</i> Returned to the camp after settling all my
affairs at the town. Sealed up our dispatches and sent off
the general's express.<a name="FNanchor_I-47" id="FNanchor_I-47" href="#Footnote_I-47" class="fnanchor">[I-47]</a> In the afternoon we were visited
by the principal men of the Little Village and the chief, to
whom I presented a flag, and made the donations which I
conceived requisite to the different Indians, on account of
horses, etc.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Aug. 31st.</i> Arranging our packs and loading our
horses, in order to fit our loads, as we expected to march on
the morrow. Up late writing letters.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 1st.</i> Struck our tents early in the morning, and
commenced loading our horses. We now discovered that
an Indian had stolen a large black horse which Cheveux
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
Blanche had presented to Lieutenant Wilkinson. I mounted
a horse to pursue him; but the interpreter sent to town, and
the chief's wife sent another in its place. We left the place
about twelve o'clock with 15 loaded horses,<a name="FNanchor_I-48" id="FNanchor_I-48" href="#Footnote_I-48" class="fnanchor">[I-48]</a> our party consisting
of two lieutenants, one doctor, two sergeants, one
corporal, 15 privates, two interpreters, three Pawnees, and
four chiefs of the Grand Osage, amounting in all to 30 warriors
and one woman. We crossed the Grand Osage fork
and a prairie N. 80° W. five miles to the fork of the Little
Osage.<a name="FNanchor_I-49" id="FNanchor_I-49" href="#Footnote_I-49" class="fnanchor">[I-49]</a> Joined by Sans Oreille and seven Little Osage, all
of whom I equipped for the march. Distance eight miles.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 2d.</i> Marched at six o'clock. Halted at ten o'clock
and two o'clock on the side of the creek [Little Osage river],
our route having been all the time on its borders. Whilst
there I was informed by a young Indian that Mr. C. Chouteau
had arrived at the towns. I conceived it proper for me
to return, which I did, accompanied by Baroney, first to the
Little Village; whence we were accompanied by Wind to
the Big Village, where we remained all night at the lodge of
Cheveux Blanche. Mr. Chouteau gave us all the news,
after which I scrawled a letter to the general and my friends.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 3d.</i> Rose early, and went to the Little Village to
breakfast. After giving my letters to Mr. Henry, and arranging
my affairs, we proceeded, and overtook our party
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
at two o'clock. They had left their first camp about four
miles. Our horses being much fatigued, we concluded to
remain all night. Sent out our red and white hunters, all
of whom only killed two turkeys. Distance four miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-50" id="FNanchor_I-50" href="#Footnote_I-50" class="fnanchor">[I-50]</a></p>

<p><i>Sept. 4th.</i> When about to march in the morning one of
our horses was missing; we left Sans Oreille, with the two
Pawnees, to search for him, and proceeded till about nine
o'clock; stopped until twelve o'clock, and then marched.
In about half an hour I was overtaken and informed that
Sans Oreille had not been able to find our horse; on which
we encamped, and sent two horses back for the load. One
of the Indians, being jealous of his wife, sent her back to
the village. After making the necessary notes, Dr. Robinson
and myself took our horses and followed the course
of a little stream until we arrived at the Grand<a name="FNanchor_I-51" id="FNanchor_I-51" href="#Footnote_I-51" class="fnanchor">[I-51]</a> river,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
which was distant about six miles. We here found a most
delightful basin of water, of 25 paces' diameter and about
100 in circumference, in which we bathed; found it deep
and delightfully pleasant. Nature scarcely ever formed a
more beautiful place for a farm. We returned to camp about
dusk, when I was informed that some of the Indians had
been dreaming and wished to return. Killed one deer, one
turkey, one raccoon. Distance [made by the main party] 13
miles.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept. 5th.</i> In the morning our Little Osage all came to
a determination to return, and, much to my surprise, Sans
Oreille among the rest. I had given an order on the chiefs
for the lost horse to be delivered to Sans Oreille's wife, previously
to my knowing that he was going back; but took
from him his gun, and the guns from all the others also.</p>

<p>In about five miles we struck a beautiful hill, which bears
south on the prairie; its elevation I suppose to be 100 feet.
From its summit the view is sublime to the east and southeast.
We waited on this hill to breakfast, and had to send
two miles for water. Killed a deer on the rise, which was
soon roasting before the fire. Here another Indian wished
to return and take his horse with him; which, as we had so
few, I could not allow, for he had already received a gun
for the use of his horse. I told him he might return, but
his horse would go to the Pawnees.</p>

<p>We marched, leaving the Osage trace, which we had
hitherto followed, and crossed the hills to a creek that was
almost dry. Descended it to the main [Little Osage] river,
where we dined [vicinity of Harding]. The discontented
Indian came up, and put on an air of satisfaction and
content.</p>

<p>We again marched about six miles further, and encamped
at the head of a small creek, about half a mile from the water.
Distance 19 miles [approaching Xenia, Bourbon Co., Kas.<a name="FNanchor_I-52" id="FNanchor_I-52" href="#Footnote_I-52" class="fnanchor">[I-52]</a>].</p>

<p><i>Sept. 6th.</i> We marched at half past six o'clock, and arrived
at a large fork of the Little Osage river, where we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
breakfasted [vicinity of Xenia]. In the holes of the creek
we discovered many fish, which, from the stripes on their
bellies and their spots, I supposed to be trout and bass;
they were 12 inches long. This brought to mind the necessity
of a net, which would have frequently afforded subsistence
to the whole party. We halted at one o'clock and
remained until four o'clock. Being told that we could not
arrive at any water, we here filled our vessels. At five
o'clock arrived at the dividing ridge, between the waters of
the Osage and the Arkansaw, alias White river,<a name="FNanchor_I-53" id="FNanchor_I-53" href="#Footnote_I-53" class="fnanchor">[I-53]</a> the dry
branches of which interlock within 20 yards of each other.
The prospect from the dividing ridge to the east and southeast
is sublime. The prairie rising and falling in regular
swells, as far as the sight can extend, produces a very beautiful
appearance. We left our course, and struck down to
the southwest on a small [tributary of Elm] creek, or
rather a puddle of water. Killed one deer. Distance 20
miles.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Sept. 7th.</i> We left this at half past six o'clock,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
before which we had a difficulty with the son of the chief,
which was accommodated. At nine o'clock we came on a
large fork [of Elm creek] and stopped for breakfast. Proceeded
on and encamped on a fine stream [Deer creek?],
where we swam our horses and bathed ourselves. Killed
four deer. Distance 15 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-54" id="FNanchor_I-54" href="#Footnote_I-54" class="fnanchor">[I-54]</a></p>

<p><i>Sept. 8th.</i> Marched early, and arrived at a grand fork
of the White river.<a name="FNanchor_I-55" id="FNanchor_I-55" href="#Footnote_I-55" class="fnanchor">[I-55]</a> The Indians were all discontented;
we had taken the wrong ford; but, as they were dispersed
through the woods, we could not be governed by their
movements. Previously to our leaving the camp, the son
of Cheveux Blanche proposed returning, and offered no
other reason than that he felt too lazy to perform the route.
The reason I offered to prevent his going was ineffectual,
and he departed with his hunter, who deprived us of one
horse. His return left us without any chief or man of consideration,
except the son of Belle Oiseau, who was but a
lad. The former appeared to be a discontented young fellow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
filled with self-pride; he certainly should have considered
it as an honor to be sent on so respectable an embassy
as he was. Another Indian, who owned one of our horses,
wished to return with him, which was positively refused
him; but fearing he might steal him, I contented him with
a present. We marched, and made the second branch
[North Big creek], crossing one prairie 12 miles, in which
we suffered much with drought. Distance 22 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-56" id="FNanchor_I-56" href="#Footnote_I-56" class="fnanchor">[I-56]</a></p>

<p><i>Sept. 9th.</i> Marched at seven o'clock, and struck a large
[Eagle] creek at 11 miles' distance. On holding a council,
it was determined to ascend this creek to the highest point
of water, and strike across to a large river of the Arkansaw
[watershed]. We ascended 4½ miles, and encamped.
Killed one cabrie [antelope, <i>Antilocapra americana</i>], two
deer, and two turkeys. Distance 12 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-57" id="FNanchor_I-57" href="#Footnote_I-57" class="fnanchor">[I-57]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept. 10th.</i> Marched early. Struck and passed the
divide between the Grand [Neosho] river and the Verdegris
[or Vermilion] river. Stopped to breakfast on a small
stream of the latter; after which we marched and encamped
on the fourth small stream [tributary of Vermilion
river]. Killed one elk, one deer. Distance 21 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-58" id="FNanchor_I-58" href="#Footnote_I-58" class="fnanchor">[I-58]</a></p>

<p><i>Sept. 11th.</i> Passed four branches and over high hilly
prairies. Encamped at night on a large branch of Grand
river. Killed one cabrie, one deer. Distance 17 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-59" id="FNanchor_I-59" href="#Footnote_I-59" class="fnanchor">[I-59]</a></p>

<p><i>Sept. 12th.</i> Commenced our march at seven o'clock.
Passed very ruff [rough] flint hills. My feet blistered and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
very sore. I stood on a hill, and in one view below me
saw buffalo, elk, deer, cabrie, and panthers. Encamped on
the main [Cottonwood] branch of Grand [Neosho] river,
which had very steep banks and was deep. Dr. Robinson,
Bradley, and Baroney arrived after dusk, having killed three
buffalo, which, with one I killed, and two by the Indians,
made six; the Indians alleging it was the Kans' hunting
ground, therefore they would destroy all the game they
possibly could. Distance 18 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-60" id="FNanchor_I-60" href="#Footnote_I-60" class="fnanchor">[I-60]</a></p>

<p><i>Sept. 13th.</i> Late in marching, it having every appearance
of rain. Halted to dine on a branch of Grand river.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
Marched again at half past two o'clock, and halted at five,
intending to dispatch Dr. Robinson and one of our Pawnees
to the village to-morrow. Killed six buffalo, one elk, and
three deer. Distance nine miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-61" id="FNanchor_I-61" href="#Footnote_I-61" class="fnanchor">[I-61]</a></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Sept. 14th.</i> The doctor and Frank, a young
Pawnee, marched for the village at daylight; we at half
past six o'clock. Halted at one o'clock. On the march we
were continually passing through large herds of buffalo,
elk, and cabrie; and I have no doubt that one hunter could
support 200 men. I prevented the men shooting at the
game, not merely because of the scarcity of ammunition,
but, as I conceived, the laws of morality forbid it also.
Encamped at sunset on the main branch [Cottonwood] of
White river, hitherto called Grand river. Killed one buffalo
and one cabrie. Distance 21 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-62" id="FNanchor_I-62" href="#Footnote_I-62" class="fnanchor">[I-62]</a></p>

<p><i>Sept. 15th.</i> Marched at seven o'clock; passed a very
large Kans encampment, evacuated, which had been occupied
last summer. Proceeded on to the dividing ridge
between the waters of White river and the Kans [more
exactly, from basin of the Cottonwood to that of the Smoky
Hill]. This ridge was covered with a layer of stone, which
was strongly impregnated with iron ore, and on the W.
side of said ridge we found spa springs. Halted at one
o'clock, very much against the inclination of the Osage,
who, from the running of the buffalo, conceived a party of
Kans to be near. Killed two buffalo. Distance 18 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-63" id="FNanchor_I-63" href="#Footnote_I-63" class="fnanchor">[I-63]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept. 16th.</i> Marched late, and in about 4½ miles' distance
came to a very handsome branch of water [Hobbs
branch of Gypsum creek], at which we stopped and remained
until after two o'clock, when we marched and crossed
two branches [main Gypsum and Stag creeks]. Encamped
on a third. At the second [Gypsum] creek, a horse was
discovered on the prairie, when Baroney went in pursuit of
him on a horse of Lieutenant Wilkinson, but arrived at our
camp without success. Distance 13 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-64" id="FNanchor_I-64" href="#Footnote_I-64" class="fnanchor">[I-64]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept. 17th.</i> Marched early and struck the main S. E.
[Smoky Hill] branch of the Kans river at nine o'clock; it
appeared to be 25 or 30 yards wide, and is navigable in the
flood seasons. We passed it six miles to a small branch to
breakfast. Game getting scarce, our provision began to run
low. Marched about two o'clock, and encamped at sundown
on a large branch [Mulberry creek]. Killed one
buffalo. Distance 21 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-65" id="FNanchor_I-65" href="#Footnote_I-65" class="fnanchor">[I-65]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept. 18th.</i> Marched at our usual hour, and at twelve
o'clock halted at a large branch [Saline river] of the Kans
[Smoky Hill], which was strongly impregnated with salt.
This day we expected the people of the [Pawnee] village to
meet us. We marched again at four o'clock. Our route
being over a continued series of hills and hollows, we were
until eight at night before we arrived at a small dry branch
[of Covert creek]. It was nearly ten o'clock before we
found any water. Commenced raining a little before day.
Distance 25 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-66" id="FNanchor_I-66" href="#Footnote_I-66" class="fnanchor">[I-66]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept. 19th.</i> It having commenced raining early, we secured
our baggage and pitched our tents. The rain continued
without any intermission the whole day, during
which we employed ourselves in reading the Bible and
Pope's Essays, and in pricking on our arms with India ink
some characters, which will frequently bring to mind our
forlorn and dreary situation, as well as the happiest days of
our life. In the rear of our encampment was a hill, on
which there was a large rock, where the Indians kept a continual
sentinel, as I imagine to apprise them of the approach
of any party, friends or foes, as well as to see if they could
discover any game on the prairies.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 20th.</i> It appearing as if we possibly might have a
clear day, I ordered our baggage spread abroad to dry; but
it shortly after clouded up and commenced raining. The
Osage sentinel discovered a buffalo on the prairies; upon
which we dispatched a hunter on horseback in pursuit of
him, also some hunters on foot; before night they killed
three buffalo, some of the best of which we brought in
and jerked or dried by the fire. It continued showery until
afternoon, when we put our baggage again in a position to
dry, and remained encamped. The detention of the doctor
and our Pawnee ambassador began to be a serious matter
of consideration.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Sept. 21st.</i> We marched at eight o'clock, although
there was every appearance of rain, and at eleven o'clock
passed a large [Little Saline river of Pike, now Covert] creek,
remarkably salt. Stopped at one o'clock on a fresh branch
of the salt creek. Our interpreter having killed an elk, we
sent out for some meat, which detained us so late that I concluded
it best to encamp where we were, in preference to
running the risk of finding no water. Distance 10 miles.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Wilkinson was attacked with a severe headache
and slight fever. One of my men had been attacked
with a touch of the pleurisy on the 18th, and was still ill.
We were informed by an Osage woman that two of the
Indians were conspiring to desert us in the night and steal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
some of our horses, one of whom was her husband. We
engaged her as our spy. Thus were we obliged to keep ourselves
on our guard against our own companions and fellow-travelers&mdash;men
of a nation highly favored by the United
States, but whom I believe to be a faithless set of poltrons,
incapable of a great and generous action. Among them,
indeed, there may be some exceptions.</p>

<p>In the evening, finding that the two Indians above mentioned
had made all preparations to depart, I sent for one
of them, who owned a horse and had received a gun and
other property for his hire, and told him "I knew his plans,
and that if he was disposed to desert, I should take care to
retain his horse; that as for himself, he might leave me if
he pleased, as I only wanted men with us." He replied
"that he was a man, that he always performed his promises,
that he had never said he would return; but that he
would follow me to the Pawnee village, which he intended
to do." He then brought his baggage and put it under
charge of the sentinel, and slept by my fire; but notwithstanding
I had him well watched.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 22d.</i> We did not march until eight o'clock, owing
to the indisposition of Lieutenant Wilkinson. At eleven
waited to dine. Light mists of rain, with flying clouds.
We marched again at three o'clock, and continued our
route 12 miles to the first branch of the Republican
Fork. [?] Met a Pawnee hunter, who informed us that
the chief had left the village the day after the doctor
arrived, with 50 or 60 horses and many people, and had
taken his course to the north of our route; consequently
we had missed each other. He likewise informed us that
the Tetaus [misprint for Tetans, and that a mistake for
Ietans, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, Comanches] had recently killed six Pawnees,
the Kans had stolen some horses, and a party of 300
Spaniards had lately been as far as the Sabine; but for
what purpose was unknown. Distance 11 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-67" id="FNanchor_I-67" href="#Footnote_I-67" class="fnanchor">[I-67]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept. 23d.</i> Marched early and passed a large fork of the
Kans [<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, Smoky Hill] river, which I [correctly] suppose
to be the one generally called Solomon's. One of our
horses fell into the water and wet his load. Halted at ten
o'clock on a branch of this fork. We marched at half past
one o'clock, and encamped at sundown on a stream [Buffalo
creek] where we had a great difficulty to find water. We
were overtaken by a Pawnee, who encamped with us. He
offered his horse for our use. Distance 21 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-68" id="FNanchor_I-68" href="#Footnote_I-68" class="fnanchor">[I-68]</a></p>

<p><i>Sept. 24th.</i> We could not find our horses until late, when
we marched. Before noon met Frank, who had accompanied
Dr. Robinson to the village, and three other Pawnees,
who informed us that the chief and his party had only
arrived at the village yesterday, and had dispatched them
out in search of us. Before three o'clock we were joined
by several Pawnees; one of them wore a scarlet coat, with
a small medal of General Washington, and a Spanish medal
also. We encamped at sunset on a middle-sized branch
[White Rock creek], and were joined by several Pawnees in
the evening, who brought us some buffalo meat. Here we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
saw some mules, horses, bridles, and blankets, which they
obtained of the Spaniards. Few only had breech cloths,
most being wrapped in buffalo robes, otherwise quite naked.
Distance 18 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-69" id="FNanchor_I-69" href="#Footnote_I-69" class="fnanchor">[I-69]</a></p>

<p><i>Sept. 25th.</i> We marched at a good hour, and in about
eight miles struck a very large road on which the Spanish
troops had returned, and on which we could yet discover
the grass beaten down in the direction which they went.</p>

<p>When we arrived within about three miles of the village,
we were requested to remain, as the ceremony of receiving
the Osage into the towns was to be performed here. There
was a small circular spot, clear of grass, before which the
Osage sat down. We were a small distance in advance of
the Indians. The Pawnees then advanced within a mile of
us, halted, divided into two troops, and came on each flank
at full charge, making all the gestures and performing the
maneuvers of a real war charge. They then encircled us
around, and the chief advanced in the center and gave us
his hand; his name was Caracterish. He was accompanied
by his two sons and a chief by the name of Iskatappe. The
Osage were still seated; but Belle Oiseau then rose, came
forward with a pipe, and presented it to the chief, who took
a whiff or two from it. We then proceeded; the chief,
Lieutenant Wilkinson, and myself in front; my sergeant, on
a white horse, next with the colors; then our horses and
baggage, escorted by our men, with the Pawnees on each
side, running races, etc. When we arrived on the hill over
the town we were again halted, and the Osage seated in
a row; when each Pawnee who intended so to do presented
them with a horse and gave a pipe to smoke to the Osage
to whom he had made the present. In this manner were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
eight horses given. Lieutenant Wilkinson then proceeded
with the party to the [Republican] river above the town,
and encamped. I went up to our camp in the evening,
having a young Pawnee with me loaded with corn for my
men. Distance 12 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-70" id="FNanchor_I-70" href="#Footnote_I-70" class="fnanchor">[I-70]</a> As the chief had invited us to
his lodge to eat, we thought it proper for one to go. At
the lodge he gave me many particulars which were interesting
to us, relative to the late visit of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>I will attempt to give some memoranda of this expedition,
which was the most important ever carried on from the
province of New Mexico, and in fact the only one directed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
N. E. (except that mentioned by the Abbe Raynal<a name="FNanchor_I-71" id="FNanchor_I-71" href="#Footnote_I-71" class="fnanchor">[I-71]</a> in his
History of the Indies) to the Pawnees&mdash;of which see a more
particular account hereafter. In the year 1806 our affairs
with Spain began to wear a very serious aspect, and the
troops of the two governments almost came to actual hostilities
on the frontiers of Texas and the Orleans territory.
At this time, when matters bore every appearance of coming
to a crisis, I was fitting out for my expedition from St.
Louis, where some of the Spanish emissaries in that country
transmitted the information to Majar. Merior [<i>sic</i>] and the
Spanish council at that place, who immediately forwarded
the information to the then commandant of Nacogdoches,
Captain Sebastian Rodreriques [<i>sic</i>] who forwarded it to
Colonel [Don Antonio] Cordero, by whom it was transmitted
to [General Don Nimesio Salcedo, at Chihuahua,]
the seat of government. This information was personally
communicated to me, as an instance of the rapid means
they possessed of transmitting information relative to the
occurrences transacting on our frontiers. The expedition
was then determined on, and had three objects in view:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span></p>

<p>1st. To descend the Red river, in order, if he met our
expedition, to intercept and turn us back; or, should Major
Sparks<a name="FNanchor_I-72" id="FNanchor_I-72" href="#Footnote_I-72" class="fnanchor">[I-72]</a> and Mr. [Thomas] Freeman have missed the party
from Nacogdoches, under the command of Captain Viana,
to oblige them to return and not penetrate further into the
country, or make them prisoners of war.</p>

<p>2d. To explore and examine all the internal parts of the
country from the frontiers of the province of New Mexico
to the Missouri between the La Platte [sentence unfinished].</p>

<p>3d. To visit the Tetaus, Pawnees republic, Grand Pawnees,
Pawnee Mahaws, and Kans.<a name="FNanchor_I-73" id="FNanchor_I-73" href="#Footnote_I-73" class="fnanchor">[I-73]</a> To the head chief of each
of those nations the commanding officer bore flags, a commission,
grand medal, and four mules; and with all of them
he had to renew the chains of ancient amity which was said
to have existed between their father, his most Catholic
majesty, and his children the red people.</p>

<p>The commanding officers also bore positive orders to
oblige all parties or persons, in the above-specified countries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
either to retire from them into the acknowledged territories
of the United States, or to make prisoners of them and conduct
them into the province of N. Mexico. Lieutenant
Don Facundo Malgares, the officer selected from the five
internal provinces to command this expedition, was a
European (his uncle was one of the royal judges in the
kingdom of New Spain), and had distinguished himself in
several long expeditions against the Apaches and other
Indian nations with whom the Spaniards were at war; added
to these circumstances, he was a man of immense fortune,
and generous in its disposal, almost to profusion; possessed
a liberal education, high sense of honor, and a disposition
formed for military enterprise. This officer marched from the
province of Biscay with 100 dragoons of the regular service,
and at Santa Fe, the place where the expedition was fitted out,
he was joined by 500 of the mounted militia of that province,
armed after the manner described by my notes on that subject,
and completely equipped with ammunition, etc., for six
months; each man leading with them (by order) two horses
and one mule, the whole number of their beasts was 2,075.
They descended the Red river 233 leagues; met the grand
bands of the Tetaus, and held councils with them; then
struck off N. E., and crossed the country to the Arkansaw,
where Lieutenant Malgares left 240 of his men with the lame
and tired horses, while he proceeded on with the rest to the
Pawnee republic. Here he was met by the chiefs and
warriors of the Grand Pawnees; held councils with the two
nations and presented them the flags, medals, etc., which were
destined for them. He did not proceed to the execution
of his mission with the Pawnee Mahaws and Kans, as he
represented to me, from the poverty of their horses and the
discontent of his own men; but, as I conceive, from the
suspicion and discontent which began to arise between the
Spaniards and the Indians; the former wished to revenge
the death of Villineuve and party, while the latter possessed
all the suspicions of conscious villainy deserving punishment.
Malgares took with him all the traders he found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
there from our country, some of whom, having been sent to
Natchitoches, were in abject poverty at that place on my
arrival, and applied to me for means to return to St. Louis.
Lieutenant Malgares returned to Santa Fe the &mdash;&mdash; of
October, when his militia was disbanded; but he remained
in the vicinity of that place until we were brought in, when
he, with dragoons, became our escort to the seat of government
[in Chihuahua].</p>

<p><i>Sept. 26th.</i> Finding our encampment not eligible as to
situation, we moved down on to the prairie hill, about
three-fourths of a mile nearer the village. We sent our
interpreter to town to trade for provisions. About three
o'clock in the afternoon 12 Kans arrived at the village, and
informed Baroney that they had come to meet us, hearing
that we were to be at the Pawnees' village. We pitched
our camp upon a beautiful eminence, whence we had a view
of the town and all that was transacting. In the evening
Baroney, with the chief, came to camp to give us the news,
and returned together.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 27th.</i> Baroney arrived from the village about one
o'clock, with Characterish, whose commission from the
Governor of New Mexico was dated Santa Fe, June 15th,
1806, and three other chiefs, to all of whom we gave a
dinner. I then made an appropriate present to each, after
which Lieutenant Wilkinson and myself accompanied them
to town, where we remained a few hours, and returned.
Appointed to-morrow for the interview with the Kans and
Osage.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Sept. 28th.</i> Held a council of the Kans and
Osage, and made them smoke of the pipe of peace. Two
of the Kans agreed to accompany us. We received a visit
from the chief of the village. Made an observation on an
emersion of one of Jupiter's satellities.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 29th.</i> Held our grand council with the Pawnees, at
which were present not less than 400 warriors, the circumstances
of which were extremely interesting. The notes I
took on my grand council held with the Pawnee nation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
were seized by the Spanish government, together with all
my speeches to the different nations. But it may be interesting
to observe here, in case they should never be
returned, that the Spaniards had left several of their flags
in this village, one of which was unfurled at the chief's door
the day of the grand council; and that among various
demands and charges I gave them was, that the said flag
should be delivered to me, and one of the United States'
flags be received and hoisted in its place. This probably was
carrying the pride of nations a little too far, as there had so
lately been a large force of Spanish cavalry at the village,
which had made a great impression on the minds of the
young men, as to their power, consequence, etc., which my
appearance with 20 infantry was by no means calculated to
remove.</p>

<p>After the chiefs had replied to various parts of my discourse,
but were silent as to the flag, I again reiterated the
demand for the flag, adding "that it was impossible for the
nation to have two fathers; that they must either be the
children of the Spaniards, or acknowledge their American
father." After a silence of some time an old man rose,
went to the door, took down the Spanish flag, brought it
and laid it at my feet; he then received the American flag,
and elevated it on the staff which had lately borne the
standard of his Catholic Majesty. This gave great satisfaction
to the Osage and Kans, both of whom decidedly avow
themselves to be under American protection. Perceiving
that every face in the council was clouded with sorrow, as
if some great national calamity were about to befall them,
I took up the contested colors, and told them "that as they
had shown themselves dutiful children in acknowledging
their great American father, I did not wish to embarrass
them with the Spaniards, for it was the wish of the Americans
that their red brethren should remain peaceably
around their own fires, and not embroil themselves in any
disputes between the white people; and that for fear the
Spaniards might return there in force again, I returned them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
their flag, but with an injunction that it should never be
hoisted again during our stay." At this there was a general
shout of applause, and the charge was particularly
attended to.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 30th.</i> Remained all day at the camp, but sent Baroney
to town, who informed me on his return that the chief
appeared to wish to throw great obstacles in our way. A
great disturbance had taken place in the village, owing to
one of the young Pawnees, Frank, who lately came from
the United States, having taken the wife of an Osage and
run away with her. The chief, in whose lodge the Osage
put up, was extremely enraged, considering it a breach of
hospitality to a person under his roof, and threatened to
kill Frank if he caught him.

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">
ITINERARY, CONTINUED: FROM THE PAWNEE VILLAGE
THROUGH KANSAS AND COLORADO TO PIKE'S PEAK,
OCT. 1ST-NOV. 30TH, 1806.</span></h2>

<p>Wednesday, Oct. 1st. Paid a visit to town and had
a very long conversation with the chief, who urged
everything in his power to induce us to turn back. Finally,
he very candidly told us that the Spaniards wished to have
gone further into our country, but he induced them to give
up the idea; that they had listened to him and he wished
us to do the same; that he had promised the Spaniards to
act as he now did, and that we must proceed no further, or
he must stop us by force of arms. My reply was, "that I
had been sent out by our great father to explore the western
country, to visit all his red children, to make peace between
them, and turn them from shedding blood; that he might
see how I had caused the Osage and Kans to meet to smoke
the pipe of peace together, and take each other by the hand
like brothers; that as yet my road had been smooth, with a
blue sky over our heads. I had not seen any blood in
our path; but he must know that the young warriors of
his great American father were not women, to be turned
back by words; that I should therefore proceed, and if he
thought proper to stop me, he could attempt it; but we
were men, well armed, and would sell our lives at a dear
rate to his nation; that we knew our great father would send
his young warriors there to gather our bones and revenge
our deaths on his people, when our spirits would rejoice in
hearing our exploits sung in the war-songs of our chiefs."
I then left his lodge and returned to camp, in considerable
perturbation of mind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span></p>

<p><i>Oct. 2d.</i> We received advice from our Kans that the
chief had given publicity to his idea of stopping us by
force of arms, which gave serious reflections to me, and was
productive of many singular expressions from my brave
lads, which called for my esteem at the same time that they
excited my laughter. Attempted to trade for horses, but
could not succeed. In the night we were alarmed by some
savages coming near our camp at full speed; but they
retreated equally rapidly, on being hailed with fierceness by
our sentinels. This created some degree of indignation in
my little band, as we had noticed that all the day had
passed without any traders presenting themselves, which
appeared as if all intercourse was interdicted. I wrote to
the secretary at war, the general, etc.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 3d.</i> The intercourse again commenced. Traded
for some horses, and wrote for my express.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 4th.</i> Two French traders arrived at the village in
order to procure horses to transport their goods from the
Missouri to the village. They gave us information that
Captains Lewis and Clark,<a name="FNanchor_II-1" id="FNanchor_II-1" href="#Footnote_II-1" class="fnanchor">[II-1]</a> with all their people, had
descended the river to St. Louis; this diffused general joy
through our party. Our trade for horses advanced none
this day.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Oct. 5th.</i> Buying horses. Preparing to march,
and finishing my letters.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 6th.</i> Marched my express.<a name="FNanchor_II-2" id="FNanchor_II-2" href="#Footnote_II-2" class="fnanchor">[II-2]</a> Purchasing horses and
preparing to march on the morrow.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 7th.</i> In the morning we found two of our newly
purchased horses missing. Sent in search of them; the
Indians brought in one pretty early. Struck our tents and
commenced loading our horses. Finding there was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
probability of our obtaining the other lost one, we marched
at 2 p. m.; and as the chief had threatened to stop us by
force of arms, we made every arrangement to make him
pay as dearly for the attempt as possible. The party was
kept compact, and marched by a road round the village,
in order that, if attacked, the savages would not have their
houses to fly to for cover. I had given orders not to
fire until within five or six paces, and then to charge with
the bayonet and saber, when I believe it would have cost
them at least 100 men to have exterminated us, which
would have been necessary. The village appeared all to
be in motion. I galloped up to the lodge of the chief,
attended by my interpreter and one soldier, but soon saw
there was no serious attempt to be made, although many
young men were walking about with their bows, arrows,
guns, and lances. After speaking to the chief with apparent
indifference, I told him that I calculated on his justice
in obtaining the horse, and that I should leave a man
until the next day at twelve o'clock to bring him out.
We then joined the party and pursued our route.</p>

<p>When I was once on the summit of the hill which
overlooks the village, I felt my mind relieved from a heavy
burden; yet all the evil I wished the Pawnees was that
I might be the instrument, in the hands of our government,
to open their ears and eyes with a strong hand, to
convince them of our power.</p>

<p>Our party now consisted of two officers, one doctor, 18
soldiers, one interpreter, three Osage men, and one woman,
making 25 warriors. We marched out and encamped on a
small branch [of Rock creek], distant seven miles, on the
same route we came in.<a name="FNanchor_II-3" id="FNanchor_II-3" href="#Footnote_II-3" class="fnanchor">[II-3]</a> Rain in the night.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span></p>

<p><i>Oct. 8th.</i> I conceived it best to send Baroney back to the
village with a present, to be offered for our horse, the chief
having suggested the propriety of this measure; he met his
son and the horse with Sparks. Marched at ten o'clock, and
at four o'clock came to the place where the Spanish troops
encamped the first night they left the Pawnee village. Their
encampment was circular, having only small fires round the
circle to cook by. We counted 59 fires; now if we allow six
men to each fire, they must have been 354 in number.<a name="FNanchor_II-4" id="FNanchor_II-4" href="#Footnote_II-4" class="fnanchor">[II-4]</a> We
encamped on a large branch of the second [Solomon's] fork
of the Kans river. Distance 18 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-5" id="FNanchor_II-5" href="#Footnote_II-5" class="fnanchor">[II-5]</a></p>

<p><i>Oct. 9th.</i> Marched at eight o'clock, being detained until
that time by our horses being at a great distance. At eleven
o'clock we found the forks of the Spanish and Pawnee roads,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
and when we halted at twelve o'clock, we were overtaken by
the second chief, Iskatappe, and the American chief with
one-third of the village. They presented us with a piece of
bear-meat.</p>

<p>When we were about to march, we discovered that the dirk
of the doctor had been stolen from behind the saddle. After
marching the men, the doctor and myself, with the interpreter,
went to the chief and demanded that he should
cause a search to be made; it was done, but when the dirk
was found, the possessor asserted that he had found it on the
road. I told him that he did not speak the truth, and informed
the chief that we never suffered a thing of ever so
little value to be taken without liberty. At this time the
prairie was covered with his men, who began to encircle us
around, and Lieutenant Wilkinson with the troops had
gained half a mile on the road. The Indian demanded a
knife before he would give it up; but as we refused to give
any, the chief took one from his belt and gave him, took the
dirk and presented it to the doctor, who immediately returned
it to the chief as a present, desired Baroney to inform
him he now saw it was not the value of the article but the
act we despised, and then galloped off.</p>

<p>In about a mile we discovered a herd of elk, which we pursued;
they took back in sight of the Pawnees, who immediately
mounted 50 or 60 young men and joined in the pursuit.
Then, for the first time in my life, I saw animals
slaughtered by the true savages with their original weapons,
bows and arrows; they buried the arrow up to the plume in
the animal. We took a piece of meat and pursued our
party; we overtook them and encamped within the Grand
or Solomon Fork, which we had crossed lower down on the
23d of September, on our route to the Pawnees. This was
the Spanish encamping ground. Distance 18 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-6" id="FNanchor_II-6" href="#Footnote_II-6" class="fnanchor">[II-6]</a></p>

<p>In the evening two Pawnees came to our camp, who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
not eaten for three days, two of which they had carried a
sick companion whom they had left this day; we gave them
for supper some meat and corn, and they immediately departed
in order to carry their sick companion this seasonable
supply. When they were coming into camp, the sentinel
challenged, it being dark; they immediately, on seeing
him bring his piece to the charge, supposing he was about to
fire on them, advanced to give him their hands; he, however,
not well discerning their motions, was on the point of
firing; but being a cool, collected little fellow, called out
that there were two Indians advancing on him, and asked if
he should fire. This brought out the guard, when the poor
affrighted savages were brought into camp, very much
alarmed, for they had not heard of a white man's being
in their country, and thought they were entering one of the
camps of their own people.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 10th.</i> Marched at seven o'clock and halted at twelve
o'clock to dine. Were overtaken by the Pawnee chief
whose party we left the day before, who informed us the
hunting-party had taken another road, and that he had come
to bid us good-by. We left a large ridge on our left, and at
sundown crossed it.... [?<a name="FNanchor_II-7" id="FNanchor_II-7" href="#Footnote_II-7" class="fnanchor">[II-7]</a>] From this place we had an
extensive view of the southwest; we observed a creek at a
distance, to which I meant to proceed. The doctor, interpreter,
and myself arrived at eight o'clock at night; found
water and wood, but had nothing to eat. Kindled a fire in
order to guide the party; but they, not being able to find
the route and not knowing the distance, encamped on the
prairie without wood or water.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 11th.</i> Ordered Baroney to return to find the party
and conduct them to our camp. The doctor and myself
went out to hunt, and on our return found all our people
had arrived, except the rear-guard, which was in sight.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
Whilst we halted five Pawnees came to our camp and brought
some bones of a horse which the Spanish troops had been
obliged to eat at their encampment on this creek. We took
up our line of march at twelve o'clock, and at sundown the
party halted on the Saline. I was in pursuit of buffalo, and
did not make the camp until near ten o'clock at night.
Killed one buffalo. Distance 12 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-8" id="FNanchor_II-8" href="#Footnote_II-8" class="fnanchor">[II-8]</a></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Oct. 12th.</i> Here Belle Oiseau and one Osage left
us, and there remained only one man and woman of that nation.
Their reason for leaving us was that our course bore
too much west, and they desired to bear more for the hunting-ground
of the Osage. In the morning we sent out to
obtain the buffalo meat, and laid by until after breakfast.
Proceeded at eleven o'clock; and crossing the [Grand Saline]
river two or three times, we passed two camps where the
Spanish troops had halted. Here they appeared to have
remained some days, their roads being so much blended with
the traces of the buffalo that we lost them entirely. This
was a mortifying stroke, as we had reason to calculate that
they had good guides, and were on the best route for wood
and water. We took a southwest direction, and before night
were fortunate enough to strike their roads on the left; and
at dusk, much to our surprise, struck the east [Smoky Hill]
fork of the Kans, or La Touche de la Cote Bucanieus.
Killed one buffalo. Distance 18 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-9" id="FNanchor_II-9" href="#Footnote_II-9" class="fnanchor">[II-9]</a></p>

<p><i>Oct. 13th.</i> The day being rainy, we did not march until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
two o'clock; when, it having an appearance of clearing off,
we raised our camp [and crossed the Smoky Hill river];
after which we marched seven miles and encamped on the
head of a branch of the river we had left. Had to go two
miles for water. Killed one cabrie.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 14th.</i> It having drizzled rain all night, and the atmosphere
being entirely obscured, we did not march until a quarter
past nine o'clock, and commenced crossing the dividing
ridge between the Kans and Arkansaw rivers.<a name="FNanchor_II-10" id="FNanchor_II-10" href="#Footnote_II-10" class="fnanchor">[II-10]</a> Arrived on
a branch of the latter at one o'clock; continued down it in
search of water until after dusk, when we found a pond on
the prairie, which induced us to halt. Sparks did not come
up, being scarcely able to walk with rheumatic pains.
Wounded several buffalo, but could not get one of them.
Distance 24 miles.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 15th.</i> In the morning rode out in search of the south
trace, and crossed the low prairie [Cheyenne Bottoms],
which was nearly all covered with ponds, but could not discover
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
it. Finding Sparks did not arrive, sent two men in
search of him, who arrived with him about eleven o'clock.
At twelve o'clock we commenced our line of march, and at
five o'clock Dr. Robinson and myself left the party at a large
[Walnut<a name="FNanchor_II-11" id="FNanchor_II-11" href="#Footnote_II-11" class="fnanchor">[II-11]</a>] creek, having pointed out a distant wood to Lieutenant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
Wilkinson for our encampment, in order to search
some distance up it for the Spanish trace. Killed two buffalo
and left part of our clothing with them to scare away
the wolves. Went in pursuit of the party. On our arrival
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
at the [Little Walnut] creek appointed for the encampment,
did not find them. Proceeded down it for some miles, and
not finding them, encamped, struck fire, and then supped on
one of our buffalo tongues.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 16th.</i> Early on horseback; proceeded up the [Little
Walnut] creek some distance in search of our party, but at
twelve o'clock crossed to our two buffaloes; found a great
many wolves at them, notwithstanding the precautions taken
to keep them off. Cooked some marrow-bones and again
mounted our horses, and proceeded down the creek to their
junction. Finding nothing of the party, I began to be seriously
alarmed for their safety. Killed two more buffalo,
made our encampment, and feasted sumptuously on the marrow-bones.
Rain in the night.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 17th.</i> Rose early, determining to search the [Little
Walnut] creek to its source. Very hard rain, accompanied
by a cold northwester all day. Encamped near night without
being able to discover any signs of the party. Our sensations
now became excruciating, not only for their personal
safety, but for fear of the failure of the national objects intended
to be accomplished by the expedition. Our own situation
was not the most agreeable, not having more than
four rounds of ammunition each, and being 400 miles in the
nearest direction from the first civilized inhabitants. We,
however, concluded to search for the party on the morrow,
and if we did not succeed in finding them, to strike the
Arkansaw, where we were in hopes to discover some traces,
if not cut off by the savages.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 18th.</i> Commenced our route at a good time, and
about ten o'clock discovered two men on horseback in search
of us&mdash;one my waiter. They informed us the party was encamped
on the Arkansaw, about three miles south of where
we then were; this surprised us very much, as we had no
conception of that river being so near. On our arrival we
were met by Lieutenant Wilkinson, who, with all the party,
was greatly concerned for our safety. The Arkansaw, on the
party's arrival, had not water in it six inches deep, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
stream was not more than 20 feet wide; but the rain of the
two days covered all the bottom of the river, which in this
place is 450 yards from bank to bank. These are not more
than four feet in height, bordered by a few cottonwood trees;
on the north side is a low swampy prairie; on the south,
a sandy sterile desert at a small distance. In the afternoon
the doctor and myself took our horses and crossed the Arkansaw,
in order to search for some trees which might
answer the purpose to make canoes; found but one, and returned
at dusk. It commenced raining at twelve o'clock.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Oct. 19th.</i> Finding the river rising rapidly, I
thought it best to secure our passage over [from the N. to
the S. bank]; we consequently made it good by ten o'clock.
Rain all day. Preparing our tools and arms for labor and
the chase on the morrow.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 20th.</i> Commenced our labor at two trees for canoes,
but one proved too much doated.<a name="FNanchor_II-12" id="FNanchor_II-12" href="#Footnote_II-12" class="fnanchor">[II-12]</a> Killed two buffalo and
one cabrie. Discharged our guns at a mark, the best shot a
prize of one tent and a pair of shoes. Our only dog was
standing at the root of the tree, in the grass; one of the balls
struck him on the head and killed him. Ceased raining
about twelve o'clock.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 21st.</i> Dr. Robinson and myself mounted our horses,
in order to go down the river to the entrance of the three
last creeks we had crossed on our route; but meeting with
buffalo, we killed four; also, one cabrie. Returned to the
camp and sent for the meat.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 22d.</i> Having sat up very late last evening, expecting
the sergeant and party, who did not arrive, we were very
anxious for them; but about ten o'clock Bradley arrived and
informed us that they could not find the buffalo which we had
killed on the prairie. They all arrived before noon. In the
afternoon we scaffolded some meat, and nearly completed
the frame of a skin canoe, which we concluded to build.
Overhauled my instruments and made some rectifications
preparatory to taking an observation, etc.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span></p>

<p><i>Oct. 23d.</i> Dr. Robinson and myself, accompanied by one
man, ascended the river with an intention of searching for
the Spanish trace; at the same time we dispatched Baroney
and our two hunters to kill some buffalo, to obtain the skins
for canoes. We ascended the river about 20 miles to a large
branch [Pawnee fork<a name="FNanchor_II-13" id="FNanchor_II-13" href="#Footnote_II-13" class="fnanchor">[II-13]</a>] on the right. Just at dusk gave
chase to a buffalo and were obliged to shoot 19 balls into
him before we killed him. Encamped on the fork [at Larned,
Pawnee Co.].</p>

<p><i>Oct. 24th.</i> We ascended the right branch [Pawnee fork]
about five miles [old Fort Larned], but could not see any
sign of the Spanish trace; this is not surprising, as the river
bears southwest, and they no doubt kept more to the west
from the head of one branch to another. We returned and
on our way killed some prairie-squirrels [<i>Cynomys ludovicianus</i>],
or wishtonwishes, and nine large rattlesnakes [<i>Crotalus
confluentus</i>], which frequent their villages. On our arrival,
found the hunters had come in a boat, one hour before,
with two buffalo and one elk skin.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span></p>

<p>The wishtonwish of the Indians, prairie-dogs of some travelers,
or squirrels, as I should be inclined to denominate
them, reside on the prairies of Louisiana in towns or villages,
having an evident police established in their communities.
The sites of their towns are generally on the brow of
a hill, near some creek or pond, in order to be convenient to
water, and that the high ground which they inhabit may not
be subject to inundation. Their residence, being under
ground, is burrowed out, and the earth, which answers the
double purpose of keeping out the water and affording an
elevated place in wet seasons to repose on, and to give them
a further and more distinct view of the country. Their holes
descend in a spiral form; therefore I could never ascertain
their depth; but I once had 140 kettles of water poured
into one of them in order to drive out the occupant, without
effect. In the circuit of the villages they clear off all the
grass, and leave the earth bare of vegetation; but whether
it is from an instinct they possess inducing them to keep the
ground thus cleared, or whether they make use of the herbage
as food, I cannot pretend to determine. The latter
opinion I think entitled to a preference, as their teeth designate
them to be of the graminivorous species, and I know of
no other substance which is produced in the vicinity of their
positions on which they could subsist; and they never extend
their excursions more than half a mile from the burrows.
They are of a dark brown color, except their bellies,
which are white. Their tails are not so long as those of our
gray squirrels, but are shaped precisely like theirs; their
teeth, head, nails, and body are the perfect squirrel, except
that they are generally fatter than that animal. Their villages
sometimes extend over two and three miles square, in
which there must be innumerable hosts of them, as there is
generally a burrow every ten steps in which there are two or
more, and you see new ones partly excavated on all the borders
of the town. We killed great numbers of them with
our rifles and found them excellent meat, after they were exposed
a night or two to the frost, by which means the rankness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
acquired by their subterraneous dwelling is corrected.
As you approach their towns, you are saluted on all sides by
the cry of "wishtonwish," from which they derive their
name with the Indians, uttered in a shrill and piercing manner.
You then observe them all retreating to the entrance
of their burrows, where they post themselves, and regard
every, even the slightest, movement that you make. It requires
a very nice shot with a rifle to kill them, as they must
be killed dead, for as long as life exists they continue to
work into their cells. It is extremely dangerous to pass
through their towns, as they abound with rattlesnakes, both
of the yellow and black species; and strange as it may appear,
I have seen the wishtonwish, the rattlesnake, the horn
frog [<i>Phrynosoma douglasi</i>], with which the prairie abounds
(termed by the Spaniards the cammellion [camaleon, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
chameleon], from their taking no visible sustenance), and a
land-tortoise, all take refuge in the same hole. I do not
pretend to assert that it was their common place of resort;
but I have witnessed the above facts more than in one
instance.<a name="FNanchor_II-14" id="FNanchor_II-14" href="#Footnote_II-14" class="fnanchor">[II-14]</a></p>

<p><i>Oct. 25th.</i> Took an observation; passed the day in
writing, and preparing for the departure of Lieutenant
Wilkinson.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Oct. 26th.</i> Delivered out a ration of corn by
way of distinction of the Sabbath. Preparing for our
departure.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 27th.</i> Delivered to Lieutenant Wilkinson letters for
the general<a name="FNanchor_II-15" id="FNanchor_II-15" href="#Footnote_II-15" class="fnanchor">[II-15]</a> and our friends, with other papers, consisting of
his instructions, traverse tables of our voyage, and a draught
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
of our route to that place complete, in order that if we were
lost, and he arrived in safety, we might not have made the
tour without some benefit to our country. He took with
him, in corn and meat, 21 days' provisions, and all the necessary
tools to build canoes or cabins. Launched his
canoes. We concluded we would separate in the morning,
he to descend [the river], and we to ascend to the mountains.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 28th.</i> As soon as possible all was in motion, my
party crossing the river to the north side, and Lieutenant
Wilkinson launching his canoes of skins and wood. We
breakfasted together, and then filed off; but I suffered my
party to march, while I remained to see Lieutenant Wilkinson
sail. This he did at ten o'clock, having one skin canoe,
made of four buffalo skins and two elk skins, which held
three men besides himself and one Osage. In his wooden
canoe were one soldier, one Osage, and their baggage; one
other soldier marched on shore.<a name="FNanchor_II-16" id="FNanchor_II-16" href="#Footnote_II-16" class="fnanchor">[II-16]</a> We parted with "God
bless you" from both parties; they appeared to sail very
well. In the pursuit of our party, Dr. Robinson, Baroney,
one soldier, and myself, killed a brelau [blaireau, badger,
<i>Taxidea americana</i>] and a buffalo; of the latter we took
only his marrow-bones and liver. Arrived where our men
had encamped, about dusk. Distance 14 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-17" id="FNanchor_II-17" href="#Footnote_II-17" class="fnanchor">[II-17]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span></p>

<p><i>Oct. 29th.</i> Marched after breakfast and in the first hour's
march passed two fires, where 21 Indians had recently
encamped, in which party, by their paintings on the rocks,
there were seven guns. Killed a buffalo, halted, made fire,
and feasted on the choice pieces of meat. About noon discovered
two horses feeding with a herd of buffalo; we
attempted to surround them, but they soon cleared our
fleetest coursers. One appeared to be an elegant horse.
These were the first wild horses we had seen. Two or three
hours before night struck the Spanish road; and, as it was
snowing, halted and encamped the party at the first woods
on the bank of the river. The doctor and myself then
forded it, the ice running very thick, in order to discover
the course the Spaniards took; but owing to the many buffalo
roads, could not ascertain it. It evidently appeared
that they had halted here some time, as the ground was
covered with horse-dung for miles around. Returned to
camp. The snow fell about two inches deep, and then it
cleared up. Distance 12 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-18" id="FNanchor_II-18" href="#Footnote_II-18" class="fnanchor">[II-18]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span></p>

<p><i>Oct. 30th.</i> In the morning sent out to kill a buffalo, to
have his marrow-bones for breakfast, which was accomplished.
After breakfast the party marched up on the north
side; the doctor and myself crossed with considerable difficulty,
on account of the ice, to the Spanish camp, where
we took a large circuit in order to discover the Spanish
trace, and came in at a point of woods south of the river,
where we found our party encamped. We discovered also
that the Spanish troops had marked the river up [<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, left
an up-river trail], and that a party of savages had been
there not more than three days before. Killed two buffalo.
Distance 4 miles. [Opposite Garfield, Pawnee Co., where
Big Coon creek falls in.<a name="FNanchor_II-19" id="FNanchor_II-19" href="#Footnote_II-19" class="fnanchor">[II-19]</a>]</p>

<p><i>Oct. 31st.</i> Fine day; marched at three quarters past
nine o'clock, on the Spanish road. Encamped, sun an
hour high, after having made 16 miles [opposite Kinsley,
Edwards Co.<a name="FNanchor_II-20" id="FNanchor_II-20" href="#Footnote_II-20" class="fnanchor">[II-20]</a>].</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span></p>

<p>We observed this day a species of crystallization on the
road, when the sun was high, in low places where there
had been water settled; on tasting it found it to be salt;
this gave in my mind some authenticity to the report of
the prairie being covered for leagues. Discovered the
trace of about 20 savages who had followed our road; and
of horses going down the river. Killed one buffalo, one
elk, one deer.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 1st.</i> Marched early; just after commencing our
line, heard a gun on our left. The doctor, Baroney, and
myself being in advance, and lying on the ground waiting
for the party, a band of cabrie came up among our horses,
to satisfy their curiosity; we could not resist the temptation
of killing two, although we had plenty of meat. At
the report of the gun they appeared astonished, and stood
still until we hallowed [hallooed] at them to drive them
away. Encamped in the evening on an island.<a name="FNanchor_II-21" id="FNanchor_II-21" href="#Footnote_II-21" class="fnanchor">[II-21]</a></p>

<p>Upon using my glass to observe the adjacent country,
I observed on the prairie a herd of horses. Dr. Robinson
and Baroney accompanied me to go and view them; when
within a quarter of a mile they discovered us, and came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
immediately up near us, making the earth tremble under
them; this brought to my recollection a charge of cavalry.
They stopped and gave us an opportunity to view them;
among them there were some very beautiful bays, blacks, and
grays, and indeed of all colors. We fired at a black horse,
with an idea of creasing<a name="FNanchor_II-22" id="FNanchor_II-22" href="#Footnote_II-22" class="fnanchor">[II-22]</a> him, but did not succeed; they
flourished round and returned again to see us, when we
returned to camp.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Nov. 2d.</i> In the morning, for the purpose of
trying the experiment, we equipped six of our fleetest
coursers with riders and ropes, to noose the wild horses, if
in our power to come among the band. They stood until
we came within forty yards of them, neighing and whinneying,
when the chase began, which we continued about
two miles, without success. Two of our horses ran up with
them; but we could not take them. Returned to camp.
I have since laughed at our folly; for taking wild horses
in that manner is scarcely ever attempted, even with the
fleetest horses and most expert ropers. See my account of
wild horses and the manner of taking them, in my dissertation
on the province of Texas. Marched late. Killed one
buffalo. River turned to north by west. Hills changed to
the north side. Distance 13½ miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-23" id="FNanchor_II-23" href="#Footnote_II-23" class="fnanchor">[II-23]</a></p>

<p><i>Nov. 3d.</i> Marched at ten o'clock. Passed numerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
herds of buffalo, elk, some horses, etc., all traveling south.
The river bottoms full of salt ponds; grass similar to our
salt meadows. Killed one buffalo. Distance 25½ miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-24" id="FNanchor_II-24" href="#Footnote_II-24" class="fnanchor">[II-24]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nov. 4th.</i> This day brought to our recollection the fate
of our countrymen at Recovery,<a name="FNanchor_II-25" id="FNanchor_II-25" href="#Footnote_II-25" class="fnanchor">[II-25]</a> when defeated by the
Indians, in the year 1791. In the afternoon discovered the
north side of the river to be covered with animals; which,
when we came to them, proved to be buffalo cows and
calves. I do not think it an exaggeration to say there were
3,000 in one view. It is worthy of remark that in all the
extent of country yet crossed, we never saw one cow, and
that now the face of the earth appeared to be covered with
them. Killed one buffalo. Distance 24½ miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-26" id="FNanchor_II-26" href="#Footnote_II-26" class="fnanchor">[II-26]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nov. 5th.</i> Marched at our usual hour; at the end of two
miles shot a buffalo and two deer, and halted, which detained
us so long that we foolishly concluded to halt this
day and kill some cows and calves, which lay on the
opposite side of the river. I took post on a hill, and sent
some horsemen over, when a scene took place which gave
a lively representation of an engagement. The herd of
buffalo being divided into separate bands covered the
prairie with dust, and first charged on the one side, then to
the other, as the pursuit of the horsemen impelled them;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
the report and smoke from the guns added to the pleasure
of the scene, which in part compensated for our detention.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 6th.</i> Marched early, but was detained two or three
hours by the cows which we killed. The cow buffalo was
equal to any meat I ever saw, and we feasted sumptuously
on the choice morsels. I will not attempt to describe the
droves of animals we now saw on our route; suffice it to
say that the face of the prairie was covered with them, on
each side of the river; their numbers exceeded imagination.
Distance 16 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-27" id="FNanchor_II-27" href="#Footnote_II-27" class="fnanchor">[II-27]</a></p>

<p><i>Nov. 7th.</i> Marched early. The herbage being very
poor, concluded to lay by on the morrow, in order to recruit
our horses. Killed three cow buffalo, one calf, two wolves,
one brelaw. Distance 18 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-28" id="FNanchor_II-28" href="#Footnote_II-28" class="fnanchor">[II-28]</a></p>

<p><i>Nov. 8th.</i> Our horses being very much jaded and our
situation very eligible, we halted all day; jerked meat,
mended mockinsons, etc.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Nov. 9th.</i> Marched early. At twelve o'clock struck
the Spanish road, which had been on the outside of us, and
which appeared to be considerably augmented. On our arrival
at the camp, found it to consist of 96 fires, from which
a reasonable conclusion might be drawn that there were
from 600 to 700 men. We this day found the face of the
country considerably changed, being hilly, with springs;
passed numerous herds of buffalo and some horses. Distance
27 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-29" id="FNanchor_II-29" href="#Footnote_II-29" class="fnanchor">[II-29]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nov. 10th.</i> The hills increased; the banks of the river
covered with groves of young cottonwood; the river itself
much narrower and crooked. Our horses growing weak;
two gave out; bring them along empty; cut down trees at
night for them to browse on. Killed one buffalo. Distance
20 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-30" id="FNanchor_II-30" href="#Footnote_II-30" class="fnanchor">[II-30]</a></p>

<p><i>Nov. 11th.</i> Marched at the usual hour. Passed two old
camps, and one of last summer, which had belonged to the
savages, and we supposed Tetaus. Passed a Spanish camp
where it appeared they remained some days, as we conjectured,
to lay up meat, previously to entering the Tetau
country, as the buffalo evidently began to grow much less
numerous. Finding the impossibility of performing the
voyage in the time proposed, I determined to spare no pains
to accomplish every object, even should it oblige me to
spend another winter in the desert. Killed one buffalo, one
brelaw. Distance 24 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-31" id="FNanchor_II-31" href="#Footnote_II-31" class="fnanchor">[II-31]</a></p>

<p><i>Nov. 12th.</i> Was obliged to leave the two horses, which
entirely gave out. Missed the Spanish road. Killed one
buffalo. Distance 20 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-32" id="FNanchor_II-32" href="#Footnote_II-32" class="fnanchor">[II-32]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nov. 13th.</i> We marched at the usual hour. The river-banks
began to be entirely covered with woods on both
sides, but no other species than cotton-wood. Discovered
very fresh signs of Indians, and one of our hunters informed
me he saw a man on horseback, ascending a ravine on our
left. Discovered signs of war-parties ascending the river.
Wounded several buffalo. Killed one turkey, the first we
have seen since we left the Pawnees. [Supposed distance
12 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-33" id="FNanchor_II-33" href="#Footnote_II-33" class="fnanchor">[II-33]</a>]</p>

<p><i>Nov. 14th.</i> In the morning, Dr. Robinson, one man and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
myself, went up the ravine in which the man was supposed
to have been seen, but could make no important discovery.
Marched at two o'clock; passed a point of red rocks and
one large creek.<a name="FNanchor_II-34" id="FNanchor_II-34" href="#Footnote_II-34" class="fnanchor">[II-34]</a> Distance 10 miles.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 15th.</i> Marched early. Passed two deep creeks<a name="FNanchor_II-35" id="FNanchor_II-35" href="#Footnote_II-35" class="fnanchor">[II-35]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
and many high points of rocks; also, large herds of
buffalo.</p>

<p>At two o'clock in the afternoon I thought I could distinguish
a mountain to our right, which appeared like a
small blue cloud; viewed it with the spy glass, and was still
more confirmed in my conjecture, yet only communicated
it to Dr. Robinson, who was in front with me; but in half
an hour they appeared in full view before us. When our
small party arrived on the hill they with one accord gave
three cheers to the Mexican mountains.<a name="FNanchor_II-36" id="FNanchor_II-36" href="#Footnote_II-36" class="fnanchor">[II-36]</a> Their appearance
can easily be imagined by those who have crossed the
Alleghenies; but their sides were whiter, as if covered with
snow, or a white stone. Those were a spur of the grand
western chain of mountains which divide the waters of the
Pacific from those of the Atlantic ocean; and it [the spur]
divides the waters which empty into the Bay of the Holy
Spirit from those of the Mississippi, as the Alleghenies do
those which discharge themselves into the latter river and
the Atlantic. They appear to present a natural boundary
between the province of Louisiana and New Mexico, and
would be a defined and natural boundary.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span></p>

<p>Before evening we discovered a fork [Purgatory river] on
the south side bearing S. 25° W.; and as the Spanish troops
appeared to have borne up it, we encamped on its banks,
about one mile from its confluence, that we might make
further discoveries on the morrow, Killed three buffalo.
Distance 24 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-37" id="FNanchor_II-37" href="#Footnote_II-37" class="fnanchor">[II-37]</a></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Nov. 16th.</i> After ascertaining that the Spanish
troops had ascended the right branch or main river, we
marched at two o'clock. The Arkansaw appeared at this
place to be much more navigable than below, where we
first struck it; and for any impediment I have yet discovered
in the river, I would not hesitate to embark in February
at its mouth and ascend to the Mexican mountains,
with crafts properly constructed. Distance 11½ miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-38" id="FNanchor_II-38" href="#Footnote_II-38" class="fnanchor">[II-38]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nov. 17th.</i> Marched at our usual hour; pushed on with
an idea of arriving at the mountains, but found at night no
visible difference in their appearance from what we did yesterday.
One of our horses gave out and was left in a ravine,
not being able to ascend the hill; but I sent back for him
and had him brought to the camp. Distance 23½ miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-39" id="FNanchor_II-39" href="#Footnote_II-39" class="fnanchor">[II-39]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nov. 18th.</i> As we discovered fresh signs of the savages,
we concluded it best to stop and kill some meat, for fear we
should get into a country where we could not kill game.
Sent out the hunters; walked myself to an eminence
whence I took the courses to the different mountains, and a
small sketch of their appearance. In the evening, found the
hunters had killed without mercy, having slain 17 buffalo
and wounded at least 20 more.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 19th.</i> Having several buffalo brought in, gave out
sufficient to last this month. I found it expedient to remain
and dry the meat, as our horses were getting very
weak, and the one died which was brought up on the 17th.
Had a general feast of marrow-bones, 136 of them furnishing
the repast.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 20th.</i> Marched at our usual hour; but as our horses'
loads were considerably augmented by the death of one
horse and the addition of 900 lbs. of meat, we moved slowly
and made only 18 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-40" id="FNanchor_II-40" href="#Footnote_II-40" class="fnanchor">[II-40]</a> Killed two buffalo and took
some choice pieces.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nov. 21st.</i> Marched at our usual hour; passed two
Spanish camps, within three miles of each other. We again
discovered the tracks of two men, who had ascended the
river yesterday. This caused us to move with caution;
but at the same time increased our anxiety to discover them.
The river was certainly as navigable here, and I think much
more so, than some hundred miles below; which I suppose
arises from its flowing through a long course of sandy soil,
which must absorb much of the water, and render it shoaler
below than above, near the mountains. Distance 21 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-41" id="FNanchor_II-41" href="#Footnote_II-41" class="fnanchor">[II-41]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nov. 22d.</i> Marched at our usual hour, and with rather
more caution than usual. After having marched about five
miles on the prairie, we descended into the bottom&mdash;the
front only<a name="FNanchor_II-42" id="FNanchor_II-42" href="#Footnote_II-42" class="fnanchor">[II-42]</a>; when Baroney cried out "<i>Voila un Savage!</i>"
We observed a number running from the woods toward us;
we advanced to them, and on turning my head to the left
I observed several running on the hill, as it were to surround
us; one with a stand of colors. This caused a
momentary halt; but perceiving those in front reaching
out their hands, and without arms, we again advanced;
they met us with open arms, crowding round to touch and
embrace us. They appeared so anxious that I dismounted
from my horse; in a moment a fellow had mounted him
and was off. I then observed that the doctor and Baroney
were in the same predicament. The Indians were embracing
the soldiers. After some time tranquillity was so far
restored, they having returned our horses all safe, as to
enable us to learn they were a war-party from the Grand
Pawnees, who had been in search of the Tetaus; but not
finding them, were now on their return. An unsuccessful
war-party, on their return home, are always ready to embrace
an opportunity of gratifying their disappointed
vengeance on the first persons whom they meet.</p>

<p>Made for the woods and unloaded our horses, when the
two partisans endeavored to arrange the party; it was with
great difficulty that they got them tranquil, and not until
there had been a bow or two bent on the occasion. When
in some order, we found them to be 60 warriors, half with
fire-arms, and half with bows, arrows, and lances. Our
party was 16 total. In a short time they were arranged in
a ring, and I took my seat between the two partisans; our
colors were placed opposite each other; the utensils for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
smoking were paraded on a small seat before us; thus far
all was well. I then ordered half a carrot of tobacco, one
dozen knives, 60 fire steels, and 60 flints to be presented
them. They demanded ammunition, corn, blankets, kettles,
etc., all of which they were refused, notwithstanding the
pressing instances of my interpreter to accord to some
points. The pipes yet lay unmoved, as if they were undetermined
whether to treat us as friends or enemies; but
after some time we were presented with a kettle of water,
drank, smoked, and ate together. During this time Dr.
Robinson was standing up to observe their actions, in order
that we might be ready to commence hostilities as soon as
they. They now took their presents and commenced distributing
them, but some malcontents threw them away, by
way of contempt.</p>

<p>We began to load our horses, when they encircled us
and commenced stealing everything they could. Finding it
was difficult to preserve my pistols, I mounted my horse,
when I found myself frequently surrounded; during which
some were endeavoring to steal the pistols. The doctor
was equally engaged in another quarter, and all the soldiers
in their positions, in taking things from them. One having
stolen my tomahawk, I informed the chief; but he paid no
respect, except to reply that "they were pitiful." Finding
this, I determined to protect ourselves, as far as was in my
power, and the affair began to take a serious aspect. I
ordered my men to take their arms and separate themselves
from the savages; at the same time declaring to them that
I would kill the first man who touched our baggage. On
which they commenced filing off immediately; we marched
about the same time, and found they had made out to steal
one sword, tomahawk, broad-ax, five canteens, and sundry
other small articles. After leaving them, when I reflected
on the subject, I felt myself sincerely mortified, that the
smallness of my number obliged me thus to submit to the
insults of lawless banditti, it being the first time a savage ever
took anything from me with the least appearance of force.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span></p>

<p>After encamping at night the doctor and myself went
about one mile back, and waylaid the road, determined in
case we discovered any of the rascals pursuing us to steal
our horses, to kill two at least; but after waiting behind
some logs until some time in the night, and discovering no
person, we returned to camp. Killed two buffalo and one
deer. Distance 17 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-43" id="FNanchor_II-43" href="#Footnote_II-43" class="fnanchor">[II-43]</a></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Nov. 23d.</i> Marched at ten o'clock; at one
o'clock came to the third fork [St. Charles river], on the
south side, and encamped at night in the point of the grand
forks [confluence of Fountain river]. As the river appeared
to be dividing itself into many small branches, and of course
must be near its extreme source, I concluded to put the
party in a defensible situation, and ascend the north fork
[Fountain river] to the high point [Pike's Peak] of the blue
mountain [Front range], which we conceived would be one
day's march, in order to be enabled, from its pinical [pinnacle],
to lay down the various branches and positions of
the country. Killed five buffalo. Distance 19 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-44" id="FNanchor_II-44" href="#Footnote_II-44" class="fnanchor">[II-44]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452-454</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nov. 24th.</i> Early in the morning we cut down 14 logs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453"></a></span>
and put up a breast work,<a name="FNanchor_II-45" id="FNanchor_II-45" href="#Footnote_II-45" class="fnanchor">[II-45]</a> five feet high on three sides and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454"></a></span>
the other thrown on the river. After giving the necessary
orders for their government during my absence, in case of
our not returning, we marched at one o'clock, with an idea
of arriving at the foot of the mountain; but found ourselves
obliged to take up our night's lodging under a single
cedar which we found in the prairie, without water and
extremely cold. Our party besides myself consisted of
Dr. Robinson, and Privates Miller and Brown. Distance 12
miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-46" id="FNanchor_II-46" href="#Footnote_II-46" class="fnanchor">[II-46]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nov. 25th.</i> Marched early, with an expectation of
ascending the mountain, but was only able to encamp at its
base, after passing over many small hills covered with
cedars and pitch-pines. Our encampment was on a
[Turkey] creek, where we found no water for several miles
from the mountain; but near its base, found springs sufficient.
Took a meridional observation, and the altitude of
the mountain. Killed two buffalo. Distance 22 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-47" id="FNanchor_II-47" href="#Footnote_II-47" class="fnanchor">[II-47]</a></p>

<p><i>Nov. 26th.</i> Expecting to return to our camp the same
evening, we left all our blankets and provisions at the foot
of the [Cheyenne] mountain. Killed a deer of a new species
[<i>Cariacus macrotis</i>], and hung his skin on a tree with some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
meat. We commenced ascending; found it very difficult,
being obliged to climb up rocks, sometimes almost perpendicular;
and after marching all day we encamped in
a cave, without blankets, victuals, or water.<a name="FNanchor_II-48" id="FNanchor_II-48" href="#Footnote_II-48" class="fnanchor">[II-48]</a> We had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
a fine clear sky, while it was snowing at the bottom. On
the side of the mountain we found only yellow and pitch-pine.
Some distance up we found buffalo; higher still the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
new species of deer, and pheasants [dusky grouse, <i>Dendragapus
obscurus</i>].</p>

<p><i>Nov. 27th.</i> Arose hungry, dry, and extremely sore, from
the inequality of the rocks on which we had lain all night,
but were amply compensated for toil by the sublimity of
the prospect below. The unbounded prairie was overhung
with clouds, which appeared like the ocean in a storm, wave
piled on wave and foaming, while the sky was perfectly
clear where we were. Commenced our march up the
mountain, and in about one hour arrived at the summit of
this chain. Here we found the snow middle-deep; no sign
of beast or bird inhabiting this region. The thermometer,
which stood at 9° above zero at the foot of the mountain,
here fell to 4° below zero. The summit of the Grand Peak,
which was entirely bare of vegetation and covered with
snow, now appeared at the distance of 15 or 16 miles from
us. It was as high again as what we had ascended, and it
would have taken a whole day's march to arrive at its base,
when I believe no human being could have ascended to its
pinical. This, with the condition of my soldiers, who had
only light overalls on, no stockings, and were in every way
ill provided to endure the inclemency of the region; the
bad prospect of killing anything to subsist on, with the
further detention of two or three days which it must occasion,
determined us to return. The clouds from below had
now ascended the mountain and entirely enveloped the
summit, on which rest eternal snows. We descended by
a long, deep ravine, with much less difficulty than contemplated.
Found all our baggage safe, but the provisions
all destroyed. It began to snow, and we sought shelter
under the side of a projecting rock, where we all four made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
a meal on one partridge and a piece of deer's ribs the ravens
had left us, being the first we had eaten in that 48 hours.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 28th.</i> Marched at nine o'clock. Kept straight on
down the [Turkey] creek to avoid the hills.<a name="FNanchor_II-49" id="FNanchor_II-49" href="#Footnote_II-49" class="fnanchor">[II-49]</a> At half past
one o'clock shot two buffalo, when we made the first full
meal we had made in three days. Encamped in a valley
under a shelving rock. The land here very rich, and covered
with old Tetau [Comanche] camps.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 29th.</i> Marched after a short repast, and arrived at
our camp before night; found all well.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Nov. 30th.</i> Marched at eleven o'clock; it snowed
very fast, but my impatience to be moving would not permit
my lying still at that camp. The doctor, Baroney, and myself
went to view a Tetau encampment, which appeared to
be about two years old; and from their having cut down so
large a quantity of trees to support their horses, we concluded
there must have been at least 1,000 souls. Passed
several more in the course of the day; also one Spanish
camp. This day came to the first cedar and pine. Killed
two deer. Distance 15 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-50" id="FNanchor_II-50" href="#Footnote_II-50" class="fnanchor">[II-50]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">
ITINERARY, CONCLUDED: IN THE MOUNTAINS OF COLORADO
ON HEADWATERS OF THE ARKANSAW AND RIO
GRANDE, DECEMBER 1ST, 1806-FEBRUARY 26TH, 1807.
</span></h2>

<p><i>Monday, Dec. 1st.</i> The storm still continuing with
violence, we remained encamped; the snow by night
was one foot deep. Our horses were obliged to scrape it
away to obtain their miserable pittance, and to increase
their misfortunes the poor animals were attacked by the
magpies, which, attracted by the scent of their sore backs,
alighted on them, and in defiance of their wincing and kicking,
picked many places quite raw. The difficulty of procuring
food rendered those birds so bold as to alight on
our men's arms and eat meat out of their hands. One of
our hunters went out, but killed nothing.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 2d.</i> It cleared off in the night, and in the morning
the thermometer stood at 17° below zero (Reaumer
[Réaumur]), being three times as cold as any morning we
had yet experienced. We killed an old buffalo on the opposite
[north] side of the river, which here was so deep as
to swim horses. Marched and found it necessary to cross
to the north side, about two miles up, as the ridge joined
the river.<a name="FNanchor_III-1" id="FNanchor_III-1" href="#Footnote_III-1" class="fnanchor">[III-1]</a> The ford was a good one, but the ice ran very
bad, and two of the men got their feet frozen before we
could get accommodated with fire, etc. Secured some of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
our old buffalo and continued our march. The country
being very rugged and hilly, one of our horses took a freak
in his head and turned back, which occasioned three of our
rear-guard to lie out all night; I was very apprehensive
they might perish on the prairie. Distance 13 miles.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 3d.</i> The weather moderating to 3° below zero, our
absentees joined, one with his feet frozen, but were not able
to bring up the horse. I sent two men back on horseback.
The hardships of last voyage [<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, that up the Mississippi,
winter of 1805-6] had now begun; and had the climate
only been as severe as the climate then was, some of the
men must have perished, for they had no winter clothing.
I wore myself cotton overalls, for I had not calculated on
being out in that inclement season of the year.</p>

<p>Dr. Robinson and myself, with assistants, went out and
took the altitude of the north mountain [Pike's Peak], on the
base of a mile. The perpendicular height of this mountain,
from the level of the prairie, was 10,581 feet, and admitting
that the prairie was 8,000 feet from the level of the sea, it
would make the elevation of this peak 18,581 feet; equal to
some and surpassing the calculated height of others for the
peak of Teneriffe, and falling short of that of Chimborazo
only 1,701 feet. Indeed, it was so remarkable as to be
known to all the savage nations for hundreds of miles
around, to be spoken of with admiration by the Spaniards of
New Mexico, and to be the bounds of their travels N. W.
In our wandering in the mountains it was never out of
sight, except when in a valley, from the 14th of November
to the 27th of January.<a name="FNanchor_III-2" id="FNanchor_III-2" href="#Footnote_III-2" class="fnanchor">[III-2]</a></p>

<p>After this, together with Sparks, we endeavored to kill a
cow, but without effect. Killed two bulls, that the men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
might use pieces of their hides for mockinsons. Left Sparks
out. On our return to camp found the men had got back
with the strayed horse, but too late to march.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 4th.</i> Marched about five o'clock; took up Sparks,
who had succeeded in killing a cow. Killed two buffaloes
and six turkeys. Distance 20 miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-3" id="FNanchor_III-3" href="#Footnote_III-3" class="fnanchor">[III-3]</a></p>

<p><i>Dec. 5th.</i> Marched at our usual hour. Passed one very
bad place of falling rocks; had to carry our loads. Encamped
on the main branch of the river [as distinguished
from Grape creek], near the entrance of the South [Wet]
mountain. In the evening walked up to the mountain.
Heard 14 guns at camp during my absence, which alarmed
me considerably; returned as quickly as possible, and found
that the cause of my alarm was their shooting turkeys.
Killed two buffaloes and nine turkeys. Distance 18 miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-4" id="FNanchor_III-4" href="#Footnote_III-4" class="fnanchor">[III-4]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dec. 6th.</i> Sent out three different parties to hunt the
Spanish trace, but without success. The doctor and myself
followed the river into the mountain, where it was bounded
on each side by the rocks of the mountain, 200 feet high,
leaving a small valley of 50 or 60 feet [in the "Royal
Gorge"]. Killed two buffaloes, two deer, one turkey.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Dec. 7th.</i> We again dispatched parties in search
of the trace. One party discovered it, on the other side of
the river, and followed it into the valley of the river at the
entrance of the mountain, where they met two parties who
were returning from exploring the two branches<a name="FNanchor_III-5" id="FNanchor_III-5" href="#Footnote_III-5" class="fnanchor">[III-5]</a> of the
river, in the mountains; of which they reported that they
had ascended until the river was merely a brook, bounded
on both sides with perpendicular rocks, impracticable for
horses ever to pass them; they had then recrossed the river
to the north side, and discovered, as they supposed, that
the Spanish troops had ascended a dry valley to the right.
On their return they found some rock-salt, samples of which
were brought me. We determined to march the morrow to
the entrance of the valley, there to examine the salt and
the road. Killed one wildcat.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 8th.</i> On examining the trace found yesterday, conceived
it to have been only a reconnoitering party, dispatched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
from the main body; and on analyzing the rock-salt, found
it to be strongly impregnated with sulphur. There were
some very strong sulphurated springs at its foot. Returned
to camp; took with me Dr. Robinson and Miller, and descended
the river, in order to discover certainly if the whole
[Spanish] party had come by this route. Descended about
seven miles on the south side [of the Arkansaw]. Saw great
quantities of turkeys and deer. Killed one deer.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 9th.</i> Before we marched, killed a fine buck at our
camp as he was passing. Found the Spanish camp about
four miles below; and, from every observation we could
make, conceived they had all ascended the river. Returned
to camp, where we arrived about two o'clock. Found
all well; would have moved immediately, but four men were
out reconnoitering. Killed three deer.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 10th.</i> Marched and found the road over the mountain
to be excellent. Encamped in a dry ravine.<a name="FNanchor_III-6" id="FNanchor_III-6" href="#Footnote_III-6" class="fnanchor">[III-6]</a> Obliged
to melt snow for ourselves and horses; and as there was
nothing else for the latter to eat, gave them one pint of corn
each. Killed one buffalo.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 11th.</i> Marched at ten o'clock, and in one mile struck
a branch [Oil creek] of the Arkansaw on which the supposed
Spaniards had encamped, where there was both water and
grass. Kept up this branch, but was frequently embarrassed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
as to the trace; at three o'clock, having no sign of it,
halted and encamped, and went out to search it; found it
about one mile to the right. Distance 15 miles.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 12th.</i> Marched at nine o'clock. Continued up the
same branch [Oil creek] as yesterday. The ridges on
our right and left appeared to grow lower, but mountains
appeared on our flanks, through the intervals, covered with
snow. Owing to the weakness of our horses, we made only
12 miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-7" id="FNanchor_III-7" href="#Footnote_III-7" class="fnanchor">[III-7]</a></p>

<p><i>Dec. 13th.</i> Marched at the usual hour; passed large
springs, and the supposed Spanish camp; crossed at twelve
o'clock a dividing ridge,<a name="FNanchor_III-8" id="FNanchor_III-8" href="#Footnote_III-8" class="fnanchor">[III-8]</a> and immediately fell on a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
branch running N. 20° W. There being no appearance of
wood, we left it and the Spanish trace to our right, and
made for the hills to encamp. After the halt I took my
gun and went out to see what discovery I could make. After
marching about two miles north, fell on a river 40 yards
wide, frozen over; which, after some investigation, I found
ran northeast. This was the occasion of much surprise, as
we had been taught to expect to meet with the branches
of Red river, which should run southeast. Query: Must it
not be the headwaters of the river Platte? [Answer: You
are on the South Platte, at the head of Eleven Mile cañon.]
If so, the Missouri must run much more west than is generally
represented; for the Platte is a small river, by no means
presenting an expectation of so extensive a course. One
horse gave out and was left. Distance 18 miles.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Dec. 14th.</i> Marched; struck the river, ascended
it four miles, and encamped on the north side.<a name="FNanchor_III-9" id="FNanchor_III-9" href="#Footnote_III-9" class="fnanchor">[III-9]</a> The prairie,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
being about two miles wide, was covered for at least six
miles along the banks of the river with horse-dung and the
marks of Indian camps, which had been made since cold
weather, as was evident by the fires which were in the center
of the lodges. The sign made by their horses was astonishing,
and would have taken a thousand horses some
months. As it was impossible to say which course the Spaniards
had pursued, amongst this multiplicity of signs, we
halted early, and discovered that they or the savages had
ascended the river. We determined to pursue them, as the
geography of the country had turned out to be so different
from our expectations. We were somewhat at a loss which
course to pursue, unless we attempted to cross the snow-capped
mountains to the southeast of us, which was almost
impossible. Burst one of our rifles, which was a great
loss, as it made three guns which had burst; five had been
broken on the march, and one of my men was now armed
with my sword and pistols. Killed two buffaloes.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 15th.</i> After repairing our guns we marched, but
were obliged to leave another horse. Ascended the river,
both sides of which were covered with old Indian camps, at
which we found corn-cobs. This induced us to believe that
those savages, although erratic, must remain long enough in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
one position to cultivate this grain, or obtain it of the Spaniards.
From their sign they must have been extremely
numerous, and possessed vast numbers of horses. My poor
fellows suffered extremely with cold, being almost naked.
Distance 10 miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-10" id="FNanchor_III-10" href="#Footnote_III-10" class="fnanchor">[III-10]</a></p>

<p><i>Dec. 16th.</i> Marched up the river about two miles and
killed a buffalo; when, finding no road up the stream, we
halted and dispatched parties in different courses, the doctor
and myself ascending high enough to enable me to lay
down the course of the river into the mountains. From a
high ridge we reconnoitered the adjacent country, and concluded,
putting the Spanish trace out of the question, to
bear our course southwest, for the head of Red river.<a name="FNanchor_III-11" id="FNanchor_III-11" href="#Footnote_III-11" class="fnanchor">[III-11]</a> One
of our party found a large camp, which had been occupied
by at least 3,000 Indians, with a large cross in the middle.
Query: Are those people Catholics? [Answer: No&mdash;party
of Comanches and Kiowas, among whom was James
Pursley.]</p>

<p><i>Dec. 17th.</i> Marched; and on striking a left-hand fork of
the river we had left, found it to be the main branch [of the
South Platte]; ascended it to some distance, but finding it
to bear too much to the north, we encamped about two
miles from it, for the purpose of benefiting by its water.
Distance 15 miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-12" id="FNanchor_III-12" href="#Footnote_III-12" class="fnanchor">[III-12]</a></p>

<p><i>Dec. 18th.</i> Marched, and crossed the mountain [one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
the Trout Creek Pass hills] which lay southwest of us; in a
distance of seven miles arrived at a small spring. Some of
our lads observed that they supposed it to be Red river, to
which I then gave very little credit. On entering a gap in the
next mountain [of the Park range], came past an excellent
spring, which formed a fine [Trout] creek. This we followed
through narrows in the mountains for about six miles.
Found many evacuated camps of Indians, the latest yet seen.
After pointing out the ground for the encampment, the
doctor and myself went on to make discoveries, as was our
usual custom, and in about four miles' march we struck what
we supposed to be Red river [but was the Arkansaw],
which here was about 25 yards wide, ran with great rapidity,
and was full of rocks. We returned to the party with the
news, which gave general pleasure. Determined to remain
a day or two in order to examine the source. Snowing.
Distance 18 miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-13" id="FNanchor_III-13" href="#Footnote_III-13" class="fnanchor">[III-13]</a></p>

<p><i>Dec. 19th.</i> Marched down the creek near the opening of
the prairie, and encamped;<a name="FNanchor_III-14" id="FNanchor_III-14" href="#Footnote_III-14" class="fnanchor">[III-14]</a> sent out parties hunting, etc.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
but had no success. Still snowing and stormy; making
preparations to take an observation.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 20th.</i> Having found a fine place for pasture on the
river, sent our horses down to it with a guard; also, three
parties out hunting, all of whom returned without success.
Took an observation. As there was no prospect of killing
any game, it was necessary that the party should leave that
place. I therefore determined that the doctor and Baroney
should descend the river in the morning; that myself and
two men would ascend; and that the rest of the party should
descend after the doctor, until they obtained provisions and
could wait for me.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Dec. 21st.</i> The doctor and Baroney marched;
the party remained for me to take a meridional observation;
after which we separated. Myself and the two men who
accompanied me, Mountjoy and Miller, ascended 12 miles<a name="FNanchor_III-15" id="FNanchor_III-15" href="#Footnote_III-15" class="fnanchor">[III-15]</a>
and encamped on the north side. The river continued close
to the north mountain [Park range], running through a
narrow rocky channel in some places not more than 20 feet
wide and at least 10 feet deep. Its banks were bordered by
yellow pine, cedar, etc.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 22d.</i> Marched up [the Arkansaw] 13 miles,<a name="FNanchor_III-16" id="FNanchor_III-16" href="#Footnote_III-16" class="fnanchor">[III-16]</a> to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
large point of the mountain, whence we had a view at least
35 miles, to where the river entered the mountains; it being
at that place not more than 10 or 15 feet wide, and properly
speaking, only a brook. From this place, after taking the
course and estimating the distance, we returned to our camp
of last evening. Killed one turkey and a hare.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 23d.</i> Marched early, and at two o'clock discovered
the trace of our party on the opposite side of the river;
forded it, although extremely cold, and marched until some
time in the night, when we arrived at the second night's encampment<a name="FNanchor_III-17" id="FNanchor_III-17" href="#Footnote_III-17" class="fnanchor">[III-17]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
of our party. Our clothing was frozen stiff,
and we ourselves were considerably benumbed.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 24th.</i> The party's provisions extended only to the
23d, and their orders were not to halt until they killed some
game, and then wait for us; consequently they might have
been considerably advanced. About eleven o'clock met
Dr. Robinson on a prairie, who informed me that he and
Baroney had been absent from the party two days without
killing anything, also without eating; but that overnight
they had killed four buffaloes, and that he was in search
of the men. I suffered the two lads [Miller, Mountjoy]
with me to go to the camp where the meat was, as we had
also been nearly two days without eating. The doctor and
myself pursued the trace and found them encamped on
the river-bottom. Sent out horses for the meat. Shortly
afterward Sparks arrived and informed us he had killed
four cows. Thus, from being in a starving condition, we
had eight beeves in our camp.<a name="FNanchor_III-18" id="FNanchor_III-18" href="#Footnote_III-18" class="fnanchor">[III-18]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span></p>

<p>We now again found ourselves all assembled together on
Christmas Eve, and appeared generally to be content, although
all the refreshment we had to celebrate that day with
was buffalo meat, without salt, or any other thing whatever.
My little excursion up the river had been in order to establish
the geography of the sources of the supposed Red river.
As I well knew that the indefatigable researches of Dr.
Hunter, [William] Dunbar, and [Thomas] Freeman had left
nothing unnoticed in the extent of their voyage up said
river, I determined that its upper branches should be equally
well explored. In this voyage I had already ascertained the
sources of the [Little] Osage and White [Neosho] rivers, been
round the head of the Kans river [<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, above the confluence
of its Smoky Hill and Republican forks], and on the headwaters
of the [South] Platte.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 25th.</i> It being stormy weather and having meat to
dry, I concluded to lie by this day. Here I must take
the liberty of observing that, in this situation, the hardships
and privations we underwent were on this day brought more
fully to our mind, having been accustomed to some degree
of relaxation, and extra enjoyments. But here, 800 miles
from the frontiers of our country, in the most inclement season
of the year&mdash;not one person clothed for the winter&mdash;many
without blankets, having been obliged to cut them up
for socks, etc., and now lying down at night on the snow or
wet ground, one side burning whilst the other was pierced
with the cold wind&mdash;such was in part the situation of the
party, whilst some were endeavoring to make a miserable
substitute of raw buffalo hide for shoes, etc. I will not speak
of diet, as I conceive that to be beneath the serious consideration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
of a man on a voyage of such a nature. We spent
the day as agreeably as could be expected from men in our
situation.</p>

<p>Caught a bird of a new species [<i>Conurus carolinensis</i>]
having made a trap for him. This bird was of a green color,
almost the size of a quail, had a small tuft on its head like
a pheasant, and was of the carnivorous species; it differed
from any bird we ever saw in the United States. We kept
him with us in a small wicker cage, feeding him on meat,
until I left the interpreter on the Arkansaw, with whom I
left it. We at one time took a companion of the same species
and put them in the same cage, when the first resident
never ceased attacking the stranger until he killed him.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 26th.</i> Marched at two o'clock and made 7½ miles
to the entrance of the mountains.<a name="FNanchor_III-19" id="FNanchor_III-19" href="#Footnote_III-19" class="fnanchor">[III-19]</a> On this piece of prairie
the river spreads considerably, and forms several small
islands; a large stream [South Arkansaw] enters from the
south. As my boy and some others were sick, I omitted
pitching our tent in order that they might have it; in consequence
of which we were completely covered with snow
on top, as well as that part on which we lay.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 27th.</i> Marched over an extremely rough road; our
horses received frequent falls, and cut themselves considerably
on the rocks. From there being no roads of buffalo,
or signs of horses, I am convinced that neither those animals,
nor the aborigines of the country, ever take this route, to go
from the source of the river out of the mountains; but that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>
they must cross one of the chains to the right or left, and
find a smoother tract to the lower country. Were obliged
to unload our horses and carry the baggage at several places.
Distance 12½ miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-20" id="FNanchor_III-20" href="#Footnote_III-20" class="fnanchor">[III-20]</a></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Dec. 28th.</i> Marched over an open space [Pleasant
Valley]; and, from the appearance before us, concluded we
were going out of the mountains; but at night encamped
at the entrance of the most perpendicular precipices on
both sides, through which the river ran and our course lay.
Distance 16 miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-21" id="FNanchor_III-21" href="#Footnote_III-21" class="fnanchor">[III-21]</a></p>

<p><i>Dec. 29th.</i> Marched; but owing to the extreme ruggedness
of the road, made but five miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-22" id="FNanchor_III-22" href="#Footnote_III-22" class="fnanchor">[III-22]</a> Saw one of a new
species of animal on the mountains; ascended to kill him,
but did not succeed. Finding the impossibility of getting
along with the horses, made one sled, which with the men
of three horses, carries their load [<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, on which the men
dragged the loads of three horses].</p>

<p><i>Dec. 30th.</i> Marched; but at half past one o'clock were
obliged to halt and send back for the sled loads, as the men
had broken it and could not proceed, owing to the waters
running over the ice. Crossed our horses twice on the ice.
Distance eight miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-23" id="FNanchor_III-23" href="#Footnote_III-23" class="fnanchor">[III-23]</a></p>

<p><i>Dec. 31st.</i> Marched; had frequently to cross the river on
the ice; horses falling down, we were obliged to pull them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
over on the ice. The river turned so much to the north as
almost induced us to believe it was the Arkansaw. Distance
10¾ miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-24" id="FNanchor_III-24" href="#Footnote_III-24" class="fnanchor">[III-24]</a></p>

<p><i>Jan. 1st, 1807.</i> The doctor and one man marched early,
in order to precede the party until they should kill a supply
of provision. We had great difficulty in getting our horses
along, some of the poor animals having nearly killed themselves
in falling on the ice. Found on the way one of the
mountain rams [bighorn, <i>Ovis montana</i>], which the doctor
and Brown had killed and left in the road. Skinned it with
horns, etc. At night ascended a mountain, and discovered
a prairie ahead about eight miles, the news of which gave
great joy to the party.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 2d.</i> Labored all day, but made only one mile; many
of our horses were much wounded in falling on the rocks.
Provision growing short, left Stoute and Miller with two
loads, to come on with a sled on the ice, which was on the
water in some of the coves. Finding it almost impossible to
proceed any further with the horses by the bed of the river,
ascended the mountain and immediately after were again
obliged to descend an almost perpendicular side of the mountain;
in effecting which, one horse fell down the precipice,
and bruised himself so miserably that I conceived it mercy
to cause the poor animal to be shot. Many others were
nearly killed with falls received. Left two more men with
loads, and tools to make sleds. The two men we had left
in the morning had passed us.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 3d.</i> Left two more men to make sleds and come
on. We pursued the river, and with great difficulty made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>
six miles by frequently cutting roads on the ice, and covering
it with earth, in order to go round precipices, etc. The
men left in the morning encamped with us at night; but
those of the day before we saw nothing of. This day two
of the horses became senseless from the bruises received on
the rocks, and were obliged to be left.<a name="FNanchor_III-25" id="FNanchor_III-25" href="#Footnote_III-25" class="fnanchor">[III-25]</a></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Jan. 4th.</i> We made the prairie about three
o'clock, when I detached Baroney and two soldiers with
the horses, in order to find some practicable way for them to
get out of the mountains light. I then divided the others
into two parties of two men each, to make sleds and bring
on the baggage. I determined to continue down the river
alone, until I could kill some sustenance, and find the two
men who left us on the 2d inst., or the doctor and his companion;
for we had no provision, and everyone had then
to depend on his own exertion for safety and subsistence.
Thus we were divided into eight different parties, viz.:
1st. The doctor and his companion; 2d. The two men
with the first sled; 3d. The interpreter and the two men
with the horses; 4th. Myself; 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, two men
each, with sleds at different distances; all of whom, except
the last, had orders, if they killed any game, to secure some
part in a conspicuous place, for their companions in the
rear. I marched about five miles on the river, which was
one continued fall through a narrow channel, with immense
cliffs on both sides.<a name="FNanchor_III-26" id="FNanchor_III-26" href="#Footnote_III-26" class="fnanchor">[III-26]</a> Near night I came to a place where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
the rocks were perpendicular on both sides, and there was
no ice, except a narrow border on the water. I began
to look about, in order to discover which way the doctor
and his companion had managed, and to find what had
become of the two lads with the first sled, when I discovered
one of the latter climbing up the side of the rocks.
I called to him; he and his companion immediately joined
me. They said they had not known whether we were
before or in the rear; that they had eaten nothing for the
last two days, and that this night they had intended to
have boiled a deer-skin to subsist on. We at length discovered
a narrow ravine, where was the trace of the doctor
and his companion; as the water had run down it and
frozen hard, it was one continuous sheet of ice. We
ascended it with the utmost difficulty and danger, loaded
with the baggage. On the summit of the first ridge we
found an encampment of the doctor, and where they had
killed a deer; but they had now no meat. He afterward
informed me that they had left the greatest part of it
hanging on a tree, but supposed the birds had destroyed it.
I left the boys to bring up the remainder of the baggage,
and went out in order to kill some subsistence; wounded
a deer, but the darkness of the night approaching, could
not find him. I returned hungry, weary, and dry, and had
only snow to supply the calls of nature. Distance 8 miles.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 5th.</i> I went out in the morning to hunt, while the
two lads were bringing up some of their loads still left at
the foot of the mountain. Wounded several deer, but was
surprised to find I killed none. On examining my gun discovered
her bent, owing, as I suppose, to some fall on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
ice or rocks; shortly afterward received a fall on the side
of a hill, which broke her off by the breach. This put me
into <i>désepoir</i>, as I calculated on it as my grandest resource
for the great part of my party; returned to my companions
sorely fatigued and hungry. I then took a double-barreled
gun and left them, with assurances that the first animal I
killed, I would return with part for their relief. About ten
o'clock rose [that is, I surmounted] the highest summit of
the [Noonan] mountain, when the unbounded spaces of the
prairie again presented themselves to my view; and from
some distant peaks I immediately recognized it to be the
outlet of the Arkansaw, which we had left nearly one
month since. This was a great mortification; but at the
same time I consoled myself with the knowledge I had
acquired of the sources of La Platte and Arkansaw rivers,
with the river to the northwest, supposed to be the Pierre
Jaun [Roche Jaune, Yellowstone<a name="FNanchor_III-27" id="FNanchor_III-27" href="#Footnote_III-27" class="fnanchor">[III-27]</a>], which scarcely any person
but a madman would ever purposely attempt to trace
further than the entrance of those mountains which had
hitherto secured their sources from the scrutinizing eye of
civilized man.</p>

<p>I arrived at the foot of the mountain and bank of the
river, in the afternoon, and at the same time discovered, on
the other shore, Baroney with the horses; they had found
quite an eligible pass [through Webster Park], and had
killed one buffalo and some deer. We proceeded to our old
camp [Cañon City], which we had left the 10th of December,
and reoccupied it. Saw the traces of the doctor and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
his companion, but could not discover their retreat. This
was my birth-day, and most fervently did I hope never to
pass another so miserably. Fired a gun off as a signal for
the doctor. Distance seven miles.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 6th.</i> Dispatched the two soldiers back with some
provision to meet the first lads and assist them on, and sent
the interpreter hunting. About eight o'clock the doctor
came in, having seen some of the men. He had been confined
to the camp for one or two days, by a vertigo which
proceeded from some berries he had eaten on the mountains.
His companion brought down six deer, which they
had at their camp; thus we again began to be out of danger
of starving. In the afternoon some of the men arrived,
and part were immediately returned with provisions, etc.
Killed three deer.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 7th.</i> Sent more men back to assist in the rear, and
to carry the poor fellows provisions; at the same time kept
Baroney and one man hunting. Killed three deer.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 8th.</i> Some of the different parties arrived. Put one
man to stocking my rifle; others were sent back to assist up
the rear. Killed two deer.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 9th.</i> The whole party were once more joined together,
when we felt comparatively happy, notwithstanding
the great mortification I experienced at having been so egregiously
deceived as to the Red river. I now felt at considerable
loss how to proceed, as any idea of services at that time
from my horses was entirely preposterous. After various
plans formed and rejected, and the most mature deliberation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
I determined to build a small place for defense and
deposit;<a name="FNanchor_III-28" id="FNanchor_III-28" href="#Footnote_III-28" class="fnanchor">[III-28]</a> leave part of the baggage, horses, my interpreter,
and one man [Smith]; and with the balance, our packs of
Indian presents, ammunition, tools, etc., on our backs, cross
the mountains on foot, find the Red river, and then send
back a party to conduct the horses and baggage by the most
eligible route we could discover; by which time the horses
would be so recovered as to be able to endure the fatigues
of the march. In consequence of this determination, some
were put to constructing the blockhouse, some to hunting,
some to taking care of horses, etc. I myself made preparations
to pursue a course of observations which would enable
me to ascertain the latitude and longitude of this situation,
which I conceived to be an important one. Killed three
deer.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 10th.</i> Killed five deer. Took equal altitudes and
angular distances of two stars, etc., but do not now recollect
which. Killed three deer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Jan. 11th.</i> Ascertained the latitude and took the
angular distances of some stars. Killed four deer.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 12th.</i> Prepared the baggage for a march by separating
it, etc. Observations continued.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 13th.</i> Weighed out each man's pack. This day I
obtained the angle between sun and moon, which I conceived
the most correct way I possessed of ascertaining the
longitude, as an immersion and emersion of Jupiter's satellites
could not be obtained. Killed four deer.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 14th.</i> We marched our party, consisting of 18 [read
12]<a name="FNanchor_III-29" id="FNanchor_III-29" href="#Footnote_III-29" class="fnanchor">[III-29]</a> soldiers, the doctor, and myself, each of us carrying
45 pounds and as much provision as he thought proper,
which, with arms, etc., made on an average 70 pounds.
Left Baroney and one man, Patrick Smith [in the blockhouse
at Cañon City].</p>

<p>We crossed the first ridge, leaving the main branch of
the river to the north of us, and struck on the south fork
[Grape creek], on which we encamped, intending to pursue
it through the mountains, as its course was more southerly.
Distance 13 miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-30" id="FNanchor_III-30" href="#Footnote_III-30" class="fnanchor">[III-30]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jan. 15th.</i> Followed up this branch and passed the main
ridge of what I term the Blue [now Wet] mountains. Halted
early. The doctor, myself, and one hunter went out with
our guns; each killed a deer, and brought them into camp.
Distance 19 miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-31" id="FNanchor_III-31" href="#Footnote_III-31" class="fnanchor">[III-31]</a></p>

<p><i>Jan. 16th.</i> Marched up the [Grape] creek all day. Encamped
early, as it was snowing. I went out to hunt, but
killed nothing. Deer on the hill; the [Wet] mountains
lessening. Distance 18 miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-32" id="FNanchor_III-32" href="#Footnote_III-32" class="fnanchor">[III-32]</a></p>

<p><i>Jan. 17th.</i> Marched about four miles, when the great
White mountain<a name="FNanchor_III-33" id="FNanchor_III-33" href="#Footnote_III-33" class="fnanchor">[III-33]</a> presented itself before us, in sight of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
which we had been for more than one month, and through
which we supposed lay the long-sought Red river. We
now left the [Grape] creek on the north of us, and bore
away more east, to a low place in the [Wet] mountains.
About sunset we came to the edge of a prairie which
bounded the foot of the [Wet] mountains. As there was
no wood or water where we were, and the woods from the
skirts of the [Sangre de Cristo] mountains appeared to be
at no great distance, I thought proper to march for it; in
the middle of said prairie crossed the creek [recrossed
Grape creek from N. E. to S. W.], which now bore east.
Here we all got our feet wet. The night commenced extremely
cold, when we halted at the woods at eight o'clock,
for encampment. After getting fires made, we discovered
that the feet of nine of our men were frozen; and, to add to
this misfortune, both of those whom we called hunters
were among the number. This night we had no provision.
Reaumer's [Réaumur's] thermometer stood at 18½° below
zero. Distance 28 miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-34" id="FNanchor_III-34" href="#Footnote_III-34" class="fnanchor">[III-34]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Jan. 18th.</i> We started two of the men least injured;
the doctor and myself, who fortunately were untouched
by the frost, also went out to hunt something to
preserve existence. Near evening we wounded a buffalo
with three balls, but had the mortification to see him run off
notwithstanding. We concluded it was useless to go home
to add to the general gloom, and went amongst some rocks,
where we encamped and sat up all night; from the intense
cold it was impossible to sleep. Hungry and without cover.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 19th.</i> We again took the field, and after crawling
about one mile in the snow, got to shoot eight times among
a gang of buffalo; we could plainly perceive two or three to
be badly wounded, but by accident they took the wind of us,
and to our great mortification all were able to run off. By
this time I had become extremely weak and faint, it being
the fourth day since we had received sustenance, all of which
we were marching hard, and the last night had scarcely
closed our eyes to sleep. We were inclining our course to a
point of woods, determined to remain absent and die by ourselves
rather than return to our camp and behold the misery
of our poor lads, when we discovered a gang of buffalo coming
along at some distance. With great exertions I made
out to run and place myself behind some cedars. By the
greatest of good luck, the first shot stopped one, which we
killed in three more shots; and by the dusk had cut each of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
us a heavy load, with which we determined immediately to
proceed to the camp, in order to relieve the anxiety of our
men and carry the poor fellows some food.</p>

<p>We arrived there about twelve o'clock, and when I threw
my load down, it was with difficulty I prevented myself from
falling; I was attacked with a giddiness of the head, which
lasted for some minutes. On the countenances of the men
was not a frown, nor a desponding eye; all seemed happy
to hail their officer and companions, yet not a mouthful
had they eaten for four days. On demanding what were
their thoughts, the sergeant replied that on the morrow the
most robust had determined to set out in search of us and
not return unless they found us, or killed something to preserve
the lives of their starving companions.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 20th.</i> The doctor and all the men able to march;
returned to the buffalo to bring in the balance of the meat.
On examining the feet of those who were frozen we found it
impossible for two of them [Sparks and Dougherty] to proceed,
and two others only without loads, by the help of a
stick. One of the former was my waiter, a promising
young lad of twenty, whose feet were so badly frozen as
to present every probability of losing them. The doctor
and party returned toward evening, loaded with the buffalo
meat.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 21st.</i> This day we separated the four loads which we
intended to leave, and took them some distance from camp,
where we secured them. I went up to the foot of the mountain
to see what prospect there was of being able to cross it,
but had not more than fairly arrived at its base when I
found the snow four or five feet deep; this obliged me to
determine to proceed and <i>côtoyer</i> the mountain [keep alongside
the base of the Sangre de Cristo range] to the south,
where it appeared lower, until we found a place where we
could cross.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 22d.</i> I furnished the two poor lads who were to remain
with ammunition, made use of every argument in my
power to encourage them to have fortitude to resist their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
fate, and gave them assurance of my sending relief as soon
as possible. We parted, but not without tears.</p>

<p>We pursued our march, taking merely sufficient provisions
for one meal, in order to leave as much as possible for the
two poor fellows who remained. They were John Sparks
and Thomas Dougherty. We went on eight miles and
encamped on a little creek,<a name="FNanchor_III-35" id="FNanchor_III-35" href="#Footnote_III-35" class="fnanchor">[III-35]</a> which came down from the
mountains. At three o'clock went out to hunt, but killed
nothing. Little snow.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 23d.</i> After showing the sergeant a point to
steer for, the doctor and myself proceeded on ahead in
hopes to kill something, as we were again without victuals.
About one o'clock it commenced snowing very hard; we
retreated to a small copse of pine, where we constructed
a camp to shelter us; and, as it was time the party should
arrive, we sallied forth to search for them. We separated,
and had not marched more than one or two miles, when
I found it impossible to keep any course without the compass
continually in my hand, and then was not able to see
more than 10 yards. I began to perceive the difficulty even
of finding the way back to our camp; and I can scarcely
conceive a more dreadful idea than remaining on the wild,
where inevitable death must have ensued. It was with
great pleasure I again reached the camp, where I found the
doctor had arrived before me. We lay down and strove to
dissipate the ideas of hunger and misery by thoughts of our
far distant homes and relatives. Distance eight miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-36" id="FNanchor_III-36" href="#Footnote_III-36" class="fnanchor">[III-36]</a></p>

<p><i>Jan. 24th.</i> We sallied out in the morning, and shortly
after perceived our little band marching through the snow
about two and a half feet deep, silent and with downcast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
countenances. We joined them and learned that, finding
the snow to fall so thickly that it was impossible to proceed,
they had encamped about one o'clock the preceding day.
As I found all the buffalo had quit the plains, I determined
to attempt the traverse of the mountain, in which we persevered
until the snow became so deep that it was impossible
to proceed; when I again turned my face to the plain,
and for the first time in the voyage found myself
discouraged.</p>

<p>This was also the first time I heard a man express himself
in a seditious manner; he [John Brown] exclaimed
that "it was more than human nature could bear, to march
three days without sustenance, through snows three feet
deep, and carry burdens only fit for horses," etc. As I knew
very well the fidelity and attachment of the majority of the
men, and even of this poor fellow (only he could not endure
fasting), and that it was in my power to chastise him when
I thought proper, I passed it unnoticed for the moment,
determined to notice it at a more auspicious time.</p>

<p>We dragged our weary and emaciated limbs along until
about ten o'clock. The doctor and myself, who were in
advance, discovered some buffalo on the plain, when we left
our loads on the snow, and gave orders to proceed to the
nearest woods to encamp. We went in pursuit of the buffalo,
which were on the move. The doctor, who was then
less reduced than myself, ran and got behind a hill and shot
one down, which stopped the remainder. We crawled up
to the dead one and shot from him as many as 12 or 14
times among the gang, when they removed out of sight.
We then proceeded to butcher the one we had shot; and
after procuring each of us a load of the meat, we marched
for the camp, the smoke of which was in view. We arrived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
at the camp, to the great joy of our brave lads, who immediately
feasted sumptuously.</p>

<p>After our repast I sent for the lad who had presumed to
speak discontentedly in the course of the day, and addressed
him to the following effect: "Brown, you this day presumed
to make use of language which was seditious, and
mutinous. I then passed it over, pitying your situation,
and attributing it to your distress rather than your inclination
to sow discontent among the party. Had I reserved
provisions for ourselves, while you were starving; had we
been marching along light and at our ease, while you were
weighed down with your burden; then you would have had
some pretext for your observations. But when we were
equally hungry, weary, emaciated, and charged with burdens
which I believe my natural strength is less able to bear than
any man's in the party; when we were always foremost in
breaking the road, in reconnoitering, and in the fatigues of
the chase, it was the height of ingratitude in you to let an
expression escape which was indicative of discontent. Your
ready compliance and firm perseverance I had reason to
expect, as the leader of men and my companions in miseries
and dangers. But your duty as a soldier called on your
obedience to your officer, and a prohibition of such language,
which for this time I will pardon; but assure you,
should it ever be repeated, by instant death will I avenge
your ingratitude and punish your disobedience. I take this
opportunity likewise to assure you, soldiers generally, of my
thanks for the obedience, perseverance, and ready contempt
of every danger which you have generally evinced. I
assure you nothing shall be wanting, on my part, to procure
you the rewards of our government and the gratitude of
your countrymen." They all appeared very much affected,
and retired with assurances of perseverance in duty, etc.
Distance nine miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-37" id="FNanchor_III-37" href="#Footnote_III-37" class="fnanchor">[III-37]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Jan. 25th.</i> I determined never again to march
with so little provision on hand; as, had the storm continued
one day longer, the animals would have continued
in the mountains; we should have become so weak as
not to be able to hunt, and of course have perished. The
doctor went out with the boys, and they secured three of
the buffalo; we commenced bringing in the meat, at which
we continued all day.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 26th.</i> Got in all the meat and dried it on a scaffold,
intending to take as much as possible along and leave one
of my frozen lads with the balance, as a deposit for the
parties who might return for their baggage, etc., on their
way back to Baroney's camp.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 27th.</i> We marched, determined to cross the [Sangre
de Cristo] mountains, leaving Menaugh<a name="FNanchor_III-38" id="FNanchor_III-38" href="#Footnote_III-38" class="fnanchor">[III-38]</a> encamped with
our deposit. After a bad day's march through snows, in
some places three feet deep, we struck on a brook which led
west. This I followed down, and shortly came to a small
stream [Sand creek], running west, which we hailed with
fervency as the waters of Red river. Saw some sign of elk.
Distance 14 miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-39" id="FNanchor_III-39" href="#Footnote_III-39" class="fnanchor">[III-39]</a></p>

<p><i>Jan. 28th.</i> Followed down the ravine and discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
after some time that there had been a road cut out; on
many trees were various hieroglyphics painted. After
marching some miles, we discovered through the lengthy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span>
vista, at a distance, another [the San Juan] chain of
mountains; and nearer by, at the foot of the White
mountains which we were then descending, sandy hills [the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
Dunes]. We marched on the outlet of the mountains, left
the sandy desert to our right, and kept down between it
and the mountain. When we encamped, I ascended one of
the largest hills of sand, and with my glass could discover
a large river [the Rio Grande], flowing nearly N. by W.
and S. by E., through the plain [San Luis valley]. This
river came out of the third chain of mountains, about N.
75° W.; the prairie between the two mountains bore nearly
N. and S. I returned to camp with the news of my discovery.
The sand-hills extended up and down the foot of
the White mountains about 15 miles, and appeared to be
about five miles in width. Their appearance was exactly
that of the sea in a storm, except as to color, not the least
sign of vegetation existing thereon. Distance 15 miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-40" id="FNanchor_III-40" href="#Footnote_III-40" class="fnanchor">[III-40]</a></p>

<p><i>Jan. 29th.</i> Finding the distance too great to attempt
crossing immediately to the river, in a direct line, we
marched obliquely to a copse of woods, which made down
a considerable distance from the mountains. Saw sign of
horses. Distance 17 miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-41" id="FNanchor_III-41" href="#Footnote_III-41" class="fnanchor">[III-41]</a></p>

<p><i>Jan. 30th.</i> We marched hard, and arrived in the evening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
on the banks of the Rio del Norte, then supposed to be
Red river. Distance 24 miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-42" id="FNanchor_III-42" href="#Footnote_III-42" class="fnanchor">[III-42]</a></p>

<p><i>Jan. 31st.</i> As there was no timber here we determined
on descending until we found timber, in order to make
transports to descend the river with, where we might
establish a position that four or five might defend against
the insolence, cupidity, and barbarity of the savages, while
the others returned to assist the poor fellows who had been
left behind at different points. We descended 18 [13]
miles, when we met a large west branch [Rio Conejos],
emptying into the main stream, about five miles up which
branch we took our station. Killed one deer. Distance 18
miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-43" id="FNanchor_III-43" href="#Footnote_III-43" class="fnanchor">[III-43]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Feb. 1st.</i> Laid out the place for our works, and
went out hunting.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 2d.</i> The doctor and myself went out to hunt, and
with great difficulty, by night, at the distance of seven or
eight miles from camp, killed one deer, which we carried in.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 3d.</i> Spent in reading, etc.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 4th.</i> Went out hunting, but could not kill anything.
One of my men killed a deer.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 5th.</i> The doctor and myself went out to hunt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span>
After chasing some deer for several hours, without success,
we ascended a high hill which lay south of our camp,
whence we had a view of all the prairies and rivers to the
north of us. It was at the same time one of the most sublime
and beautiful inland prospects ever presented to the
eyes of man. The prairie, lying nearly north and south,
was probably 60 miles by 45. The main river, bursting out
of the western mountain, and meeting from the northeast
a large branch [San Luis creek] which divides the chain of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>
mountains, proceeds down the prairie, making many large
and beautiful islands, one of which I judge contains 100,000
acres of land, all meadow ground, covered with innumerable
herds of deer. About six miles from the mountains [San
Luis hills] which cross the prairie at the south end, a branch
[Alamosa or La Jara creek] of 12 steps wide pays its tribute
to the main stream from the west course. Due W. 12°.
N. 75°. W. 6° [<i>sic</i>]. Four miles below is a stream [Trinchera
creek] of the same size, which enters on the east and
up which was a large road; its general course is N. 65° E.
From the entrance of this was about three miles, down to
the junction of the west fork [Rio Conejos], which waters
the foot of the hill on the north, while the main river wound
along its meanders on the east. In short, this view combined
the sublime and the beautiful. The great and lofty
mountains, covered with eternal snows, seemed to surround
the luxuriant vale, crowned with perennial flowers, like a
terrestrial paradise shut out from the view of man.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 6th.</i> The doctor, having some pecuniary demands
in the province of New Mexico, conceived this to be the
most eligible point for him to go in, and return previous to
all my party having joined me from the Arkansaw, and that
I was prepared to descend to Nachitoches. He therefore
this day made his preparations for marching to-morrow.
I went out hunting, and killed at three miles' distance a deer
which, with great difficulty, I brought in whole. We continued
to go on with the works of our stockade or breastwork,
which was situated on the north bank of the west
branch, about five miles from its junction with the main
river, and was on a strong plan.</p>

<p>The stockade was situated in a small prairie on the west
fork [Conejos river] of the Rio [Grande] del Norte. The
south flank joined the edge of the river, which at that place
was not fordable; the east and west curtains were flanked
by bastions in the northeast and northwest angles, which
likewise flanked the curtain of the north side of the work.
The stockade from the center of the angle of the bastions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>
was 36 feet square. Heavy cottonwood logs, about two
feet in diameter, were laid up all round about six feet, after
which lighter ones, until we made it 12 feet in height; these
logs were joined together by a lap of about two feet at each
end. We then dug a small ditch on the inside all round,
making it perpendicular on the internal side and sloping
next the work. In this ditch we planted small stakes, about
six inches in diameter, sharpened at the upper end to a nice
point, and slanted them over the top of the work, giving
them about 2½ feet projection. We then secured them
above and below in that position, which formed a small
pointed frise, which must have been removed before the
works could have been scaled. Lastly, we had dug a ditch
round the whole, four feet wide, and let the water in all
round. The earth taken out, being thrown against the
work, formed an excellent rampart against small-arms, three
or four feet high. Our mode of getting in was to crawl
over the ditch on a plank, and into a small hole sunk below
the level of the work near the river for that purpose. Our
port-holes were pierced about eight feet from the ground,
and a platform was prepared to shoot from. Thus fortified,
I should not have had the least hesitation of putting the
100 Spanish horse at defiance until the first or second night,
and then to have made our escape under cover of the darkness;
or made a sally and dispersed them, when resting
under a full confidence of our being panic-struck by their
numbers and force.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 7th.</i> The doctor marched alone for Santa Fe; and
as it was uncertain whether this gentleman would ever join
me again, I at that time committed to paper the following
testimonial of respect for his good qualities, which I do not,
at this time, feel any disposition to efface. He has had the
benefit of a liberal education, without having spent his time,
as too many of our gentlemen do in colleges, in skimming
on the surfaces of sciences, without ever endeavoring to
make themselves masters of the solid foundations. Robinson
studied and reasoned; with these qualifications he possessed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>
a liberality of mind too great ever to reject an hypothesis
because it was not agreeable to the dogmas of the
schools; or adopt it because it had all the eclat of novelty.
His soul could conceive great actions, and his hand was
ready to achieve them; in short, it may truly be said that
nothing was above his genius, nor anything so minute that
he conceived it entirely unworthy of consideration. As
a gentleman and companion in dangers, difficulties, and
hardships, I in particular, and the expedition generally, owe
much to his exertions.</p>

<p>The demands which Dr. Robinson had on persons in New
Mexico, although legitimate, were in some degree spurious
<i>in his hands</i>.<a name="FNanchor_III-44" id="FNanchor_III-44" href="#Footnote_III-44" class="fnanchor">[III-44]</a> The circumstances were as follows: In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
year 1804, William Morrison, Esq., an enterprising merchant
of Kaskaskias, sent a man by the name of Babtiste La
Lande, a Creole of the country, up the Missouri and La
Platte, directing him if possible to push into Santa Fe. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>
sent in Indians, and the Spaniards came out with horses
and carried him and his goods into the province. Finding
that he sold the goods high, had land offered him, and the
women kind, he concluded to expatriate himself and convert
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">502</a></span>
the property of Morrison to his own benefit. When
I was about to sail, Morrison, conceiving that it was
possible that I might meet some Spanish factors on
the Red river, intrusted me with the claim, in order, if
they were acquainted with La Lande, I might negotiate
the thing with some of them. When on the frontiers,
the idea suggested itself to us of making this claim
a pretext for Robinson to visit Santa Fe. We therefore
gave it the proper appearance, and he marched for that
place. Our views were to gain a knowledge of the country,
the prospect of trade, force, etc.; while, at the same time,
our treaties with Spain guaranteed to him, as a citizen of
the United States, the right of seeking the recovery of all
just debts or demands before the legal and authorized
tribunals of the country, as a franchised inhabitant of the
same, as specified in the 22d article of said treaty.</p>

<p>In the evening I dispatched Corporal Jackson with four
men, to recross the mountains, in order to bring in the baggage
left with the frozen lads, and to see if they were yet
able to come on. This detachment left me with four men
only, two of whom had their feet frozen; they were employed
in finishing the stockade, and myself to support
them by the chase.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Feb. 8th.</i> Refreshing my memory as to the
French grammar, and overseeing the works.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 9th.</i> Hunting, etc.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 10th.</i> Read and labored at our works.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 11th.</i> Hunting. Killed three deer.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 12th.</i> Studying.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 13th.</i> Hunting. Killed two deer.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 14th.</i> Crossed the [Conejos] river and examined the
numerous springs which issued from the foot of the hill,
opposite our camp. These were so strongly impregnated
with mineral qualities, as not only to keep clear of ice
previous to their joining the main branch, but to keep open
the west fork until its junction with the main river and for
a few miles afterward, while all the other branches in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">503</a></span>
neighborhood were bound in the adamantine chains of
winter.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Feb. 15th.</i> Reading, etc. Works going on.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 16th.</i> I took one man and went out hunting; about
six miles from the post, shot and wounded a deer.</p>

<p>Immediately afterward I discovered two horsemen rising
the summit of a hill, about half a mile to our right. As
my orders were to avoid giving alarm or offense to the
Spanish government of New Mexico, I endeavored to avoid
them at first; but when we attempted to retreat, they pursued
us at full charge, flourishing their lances; and when
we advanced, they would retire as fast as their horses could
carry them. Seeing this, we got in a small ravine, in hopes
to decoy them near enough to oblige them to come to
a parley; which happened agreeably to our desires, as they
came on, hunting us with great caution. We suffered them
to get within 40 yards&mdash;where we had allured them; but
they were about running off again, when I ordered the
soldier to lay down his arms and walk toward them, at the
same time standing ready with my rifle to kill either who
should lift an arm in an hostile manner. I then hollowed
to them that we were "Americans," and "friends," which
were almost the only two words I knew in the Spanish
language; when, with great signs of fear, they came up,
and proved to be a Spanish dragoon and a civilized Indian,
armed after their manner, of which we see a description in
the Essai Militaire.<a name="FNanchor_III-45" id="FNanchor_III-45" href="#Footnote_III-45" class="fnanchor">[III-45]</a> We were jealous of our arms on both
sides, and acted with great precaution.</p>

<p>They informed me that this was the fourth day since they
had left Santa Fe; that Robinson had arrived there, and
been received with great kindness by the governor. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span>
I knew them to be spies, I thought proper to inform them
merely that I was about to descend the river to Nachitoches.
We sat on the ground a long time, till, finding they
were determined not to leave us, we rose and bade them
adieu. But they demanded where our camp was; and,
finding they were not about to leave us, I thought it most
proper to take them with me, thinking we were on Red
river, and of course in the territory claimed by the United
States.<a name="FNanchor_III-46" id="FNanchor_III-46" href="#Footnote_III-46" class="fnanchor">[III-46]</a></p>

<p>We took the road to my fort, and as they were on horseback,
they traveled rather faster than myself; they were
halted by the sentinel, and immediately retreated much
surprised. When I came up, I took them in, and then
explained to them, as well as possible, my intention of
descending the river to Nachitoches; but at the same time
told them that if Governor Allencaster would send out an
officer with an interpreter who spoke French or English,
I would do myself the pleasure to give his Excellency every
reasonable satisfaction as to my intentions in coming on
his frontiers. They informed me that on the second day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>
they would be in Santa Fe, but were careful never to suggest
an idea of my being on the Rio del Norte. As they
concluded, I did not think as I spoke. They were very
anxious to ascertain our numbers, etc.; seeing only five
men here, they could not believe we came without horses.
To this I did not think proper to give them any satisfaction,
giving them to understand we were in many
parties, etc.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 17th.</i> In the morning, our two Spanish visitors
departed, after I had made them some trifling presents,
with which they seemed highly delighted. After their
departure, we commenced working at our little stockade, as
I thought it probable the governor might dispute my right
to descend the Red river, and send out Indians, or some
light party, to attack us; I therefore determined to be as
much prepared to receive them as possible.</p>

<p>This evening the corporal and three of the [four] men
arrived, who had been sent back to the camp of the frozen
lads. They informed me that two men would arrive the next
day, one of whom was Menaugh, who had been left alone on
the 27th of January [and the other of whom was the fourth
one of the soldiers who had gone as a relief-party under
Corporal Jackson]; but that the other two, Dougherty and
Sparks, were unable to come in. They said that they
[Dougherty and Sparks] had hailed them [the relief-party]
with tears of joy, and were in despair when they again left
them, with the chance of never seeing them more. They
sent on to me some of the bones taken out of their feet,
and conjured me, by all that was sacred, not to leave them
to perish far from the civilized world. Ah! little did they
know my heart, if they could suspect me of conduct so
ungenerous. No! before they should be left, I would for
months have carried the end of a litter, in order to secure
them the happiness of once more seeing their native homes,
and being received in the bosom of a grateful country.
Thus those poor lads are to be invalids for life, made infirm
at the commencement of manhood and in the prime of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>
course, doomed to pass the remainder of their days in
misery and want. For what is the pension? Not sufficient
to buy a man his victuals. What man would even lose the
smallest of his joints for such a trifling pittance?</p>

<p><i>Feb. 18th.</i> The other two boys [Menaugh and the fourth
member of the relief-party] arrived. In the evening I
ordered the sergeant [Meek] and one man [Miller] to prepare
to march to-morrow for the [stockade on the] Arkansaw,
where we had left our interpreter [Vasquez, with
Patrick Smith], horses, etc., to conduct them on, and on his
return to bring the two lads [Dougherty and Sparks] who
were still in the mountains.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 19th.</i> Sergeant William E. Meek marched with one
man, whose name was Theodore Miller, and I took three
other men to accompany him some distance, in order to
point out to him a pass<a name="FNanchor_III-47" id="FNanchor_III-47" href="#Footnote_III-47" class="fnanchor">[III-47]</a> in the mountain which I conceived
more eligible for horses than the one by which we came.
I must here remark the effect of habit, discipline, and
example, in two soldiers soliciting a command of more than
180 miles, over two great ridges of mountains covered with
snow, inhabited by bands of unknown savages, in the interest
of a nation with which we were not on the best understanding.
To perform this journey, each had about ten pounds
of venison. Only let me ask, What would our soldiers
generally think, on being ordered on such a tour, thus
equipped? Yet those men volunteered it with others, and
were chosen; for which they thought themselves highly
honored. We accompanied them about six miles, and
pointed out the pass alluded to, in a particular manner.
But the corporal afterward reported that the new one which
I obliged him to take was impassable, he having been three
days in snows nearly middle deep.</p>

<p>We then separated and, having killed a deer, sent one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>
the men back to the fort with it. With the other two,
I kept on my exploring trip down the river on the east side,
at some leagues from its banks, intending to return up it.
At nine o'clock at night we encamped on a small creek<a name="FNanchor_III-48" id="FNanchor_III-48" href="#Footnote_III-48" class="fnanchor">[III-48]</a>
which emptied into the river from a nearly due east course.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 20th.</i> We marched down the river for a few hours;
but, seeing no fresh sign of persons, or any other object to
attract our attention, took up our route for the fort. Discovered
the sign of horses and men on the shore. We
arrived after night and found all well.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 21st.</i> As I was suspicious that possibly some party
of Indians might be harboring round, I gave particular
orders to my men, if they discovered any people, to endeavor
to retreat undiscovered; but if not, never to run,
and not to suffer themselves to be disarmed or taken
prisoners, but conduct whatever party discovered them, if
they could not escape, to the fort.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Feb. 22d.</i> As I began to think it was time we
received a visit from the Spaniards or their emissaries, I
established a lookout guard on the top of a hill all day, and
at night a sentinel in a bastion on the land side. Studying,
reading, and working at our ditch to bring the river round
the works.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 23d.</i> Reading, writing, etc.; the men at their usual
work.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 24th.</i> Took one man with me and went out on the
Spanish road hunting; killed one deer and wounded several
others. As we were a great distance from the fort, we
encamped near the road all night. Saw several signs of
horses.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 25th.</i> Killed two more deer, when we marched for
our post. Took all three of the deer with us, and arrived
about nine o'clock at night, as much fatigued as ever I was
in my life. Our arrival dissipated the anxiety of the men,
who began to be apprehensive we were taken or killed by
some of the savages.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span></p>

<p><i>Feb. 26th.</i> In the morning was apprized of the approach
of strangers by the report of a gun from my lookout guard.
Immediately afterward two Frenchmen arrived. My sentinel
halted them, and ordered them to be admitted, after
some questions. They informed me that his Excellency,
Governor [Joachin R.] Allencaster, had heard it was the
intention of the Utah Indians to attack me; had detached
an officer with 50 dragoons to come out and protect me;
and that they would be here in two days. To this I made
no reply: but shortly after the party came in sight, to the
number, as I afterward learned, of 50 dragoons and 50
mounted militia of the province, armed in the same manner
with lances, escopates,<a name="FNanchor_III-49" id="FNanchor_III-49" href="#Footnote_III-49" class="fnanchor">[III-49]</a> and pistols. My sentinel halted
them at the distance of about 50 yards. I had the works
manned. I thought it most proper to send out the two
Frenchmen to inform the commanding officer that it was
my request he should leave his party in the small copse of
woods where he was halted, and that I would meet him
myself in the prairie in which our work was situated. This
I did, with my sword on me only. I was then introduced
to Don Ignatio Saltelo and Don Bartholemew Fernandez,
two lieutenants, the former the commandant of the party.
I gave them an invitation to enter the works, but requested
the troops might remain where they were. This was complied
with. When they came round and discovered that to
enter they were obliged to crawl on their bellies over a
small draw-bridge, they appeared astonished, but entered
without further hesitation.</p>

<p>We first breakfasted on deer, meal, goose, and some biscuit
which the civilized Indian who came out as a spy had
brought me. After breakfast the commanding officer
addressed me as follows:</p>

<p>"Sir, the governor of New Mexico, being informed you
had missed your route, ordered me to offer you, in his
name, mules, horses, money, or whatever you might stand in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">509</a></span>
need of to conduct you to the head of Red river; as from
Santa Fe to where it is sometimes navigable is eight days'
journey, and we have guides and the routes of the traders
to conduct us."</p>

<p>"What," said I, interrupting him, "is not this the Red
river?"</p>

<p>"No, Sir! The Rio del Norte."</p>

<p>I immediately ordered my flag to be taken down and
rolled up, feeling how sensibly I had committed myself in
entering their territory, and conscious that they must have
positive orders to take me in.</p>

<p>He now added that he "had provided 100 mules and
horses to take in my party and baggage, and how anxious
his Excellency was to see me at Santa Fe." I stated to
him the absence of my sergeant [Meek, with Miller], the
situation of the balance of the party [Vasquez and Smith
in the stockade on the Arkansaw; Dougherty and Sparks
in the mountains with frozen feet], and that my orders
would not justify my entering into the Spanish territory.
He urged still further, until I began to feel myself a little
heated in the argument; and told him, in a peremptory
style, that I would not go until the arrival of my sergeant
with the balance of the party. He replied, "that there was
not the least restraint to be used; that it was only necessary
his Excellency should receive an explanation of my
business on his frontier; that I could go now, or on the
arrival of my party; that, if none went in at present, he
should be obliged to send in for provisions; but that, if I
would now march, he would leave an Indian interpreter and
an escort of dragoons to conduct the sergeant [Meek, and
the five other absentees&mdash;Miller of the relief-party, Vasquez,
Smith, Sparks, Dougherty] into Santa Fe." His mildness
induced me to tell him that I would march, but must leave
two men [Jackson and Carter] to meet the sergeant and
party, to instruct him as to coming in, as he never would
come without a fight, if not ordered.</p>

<p>I was induced to consent to this measure by the conviction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>
that the officer had positive orders to bring me in;
and as I had no orders to commit hostilities, and indeed
had committed myself, although innocently, by violating
their territory, I conceived it would appear better to show
a will to come to an explanation than to be in any way constrained;
yet my situation was so eligible, and I could so
easily have put them at defiance, that it was with great
reluctance I suffered all our labor to be lost without once
trying the efficacy of it. My compliance seemed to spread
general joy through their party, as soon as it was communicated;
but it appeared to be different with my men,
who wished to have "a little dust," as they expressed themselves,
and were likewise fearful of treachery.</p>

<p>My determination being once taken, I gave permission
for the Spanish lieutenant's men to come to the outside of
the works, and some of mine to go out and see them. The
hospitality and goodness of the Creoles and Metifs began
to manifest itself by their producing their provision and
giving it to my men, covering them with their blankets, etc.</p>

<p>After writing orders to my sergeant [Meek], and leaving
them with my corporal [Jackson] and one private [not
named (Carter)], who were to remain, we<a name="FNanchor_III-50" id="FNanchor_III-50" href="#Footnote_III-50" class="fnanchor">[III-50]</a> sallied forth,
mounted our horses, and went up the river about 12
miles, to a place where the Spanish officers had made
a camp deposit, whence we sent down mules for our
baggage, etc.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">PIKE'S DISSERTATION ON LOUISIANA.<a name="FNanchor_IV-1" id="FNanchor_IV-1" href="#Footnote_IV-1" class="fnanchor">[IV-1]</a></span></h2>

<p>From the entrance of the Missouri, on the south bank
the land is low until you arrive at Belle Fontaine, four
miles from its entrance. In this distance are several strata
of soil, one rising above the other. As the river is cutting
off the north point, and making land on the south, this is
well timbered with oak, walnut, ash, etc.</p>

<p>From Belle Fontaine to St. Charles the north side of the
Missouri is low, bounded on its banks by timbered land
extending from half a mile to one mile from the river. Six
miles below St. Charles, on the south side, in front of a
village called Florissant, is a coal hill, or, as it is termed by
the French, La Charbonniere. This is one solid stone hill,
which probably affords sufficient fuel for all the population
of Louisiana. St. Charles is situated on the west side of
the Missouri, where the hill first joins the river, and is laid
out parallel to the stream.</p>

<p>The main street is on the first bank, the second on the
top of the hill. On this street is situated a round wooden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">512</a></span>
tower, formerly occupied by the Spaniards as a fort or
guard-house, now converted into a prison. From this
tower you have an extensive view of the river below. St.
Charles consists of about 80 houses, principally occupied by
Indian traders or their engagees. It is the seat of justice for
the district of St. Charles.</p>

<p>From St. Charles to the village of La Charrette, the west
side is generally low, but with hills running parallel at a
great distance back from the river; the south side is more
hilly, with springs. Scattering settlements are on both
sides.</p>

<p>La Charrette is the last settlement we saw on the Missouri,
although there is one above, at a saline on the west
side. From La Charrette to the Gasconade river, you
find on the north low land heavily timbered; on the south,
hills, rivulets, and a small number of small creeks, with very
high cane. The Gasconade is 200 yards wide at its entrance;
it is navigable at certain seasons 100 miles. At the
time we were at it, it was backed by the Mississippi,<a name="FNanchor_IV-2" id="FNanchor_IV-2" href="#Footnote_IV-2" class="fnanchor">[IV-2]</a> but
was clear and transparent above their confluence. On the
side opposite their confluence commences the line between
the Sac Indians and the United States. [See <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43774/43774-h/43774-h.htm#Page_339">p. 339</a>, and
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43774/43774-h/43774-h.htm#Footnote_I-14">note<sup>14</sup>, p. 11.</a>]</p>

<p>From the Gasconade to the entrance of the Osage river,
the south side of the river is hilly but well timbered. On
the north are low bottoms and heavy timber. In this space
of the Missouri, from its [the Gasconade's] entrance to
the Osage river, we find it well timbered, rich in soil, and
very proper for the cultivation of all the productions of our
Middle and Western States. It is timbered generally with
cottonwood, ash, oak, pecan, hickory, and some elm; but
the cottonwood predominates on all the made bottoms.
From the entrance of the Osage river to the Gravel river,
a distance of 118 miles, the banks of the Osage are covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">513</a></span>
with timber and possess a very rich soil. Small hills, with
rocks, alternately border the eastern and western shores;
the bottoms being very excellent soil, and the country
abounding in game. From thence to the Yungar, the river
continues the same in appearance; the shoals and islands
being designated on the chart. The Yungar, or Ne-hem-gar,
as termed by the Indians, derives its name from the vast
number of springs at its source; it is supposed to be nearly
as extensive as the Osage river, navigable for canoes 100
miles, and is celebrated for the abundance of bear which are
found on its branches. On it hunt the Chasseurs du Bois
of Louisiana, Osage, and Creeks or Muskogees, a wandering
party of whom have established themselves in Louisiana;
and between whom and the French hunters frequent skirmishes
have passed on the head of the Yungar.</p>

<p>A few miles above this river the Osage river becomes
narrower, and evidently shows the loss experienced by the
deficiency of [gain not as yet acquired from] the waters of
the Yungar. On the east shore is a pond of water, about
20 paces from the bank of the river, and half a mile in circumference;
it was elevated at least 20 feet above the surface
of the river. This appeared the more singular, as the
soil appeared to be sandy, whence it would be concluded
that the waters of the pond would speedily discharge
through the soil into the river; but there appeared to be
no reason for any such deduction.</p>

<p>Thence to a few miles below the Park (see chart [and
<a href="#aug14">diary of Aug. 14th</a>]), the banks of the river continue as
usual. We now, for the first time, were entertained with
the sight of prairie land; but it still was interspersed with
clumps of woodland, which diversified the prospect.</p>

<p>In this district the cliffs, which generally bordered one of
the sides of the river, were covered with the largest and
most beautiful cedars I ever saw. Thence to the Grand
Forks [confluence of Little with main Osage], the banks of
the river continue the same; but thence up to the Osage
town, there is a larger proportion of prairie. At the place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">514</a></span>
where Mr. Chouteau formerly had his trading-establishment,
the east bank of the river is an entire bed of stone-coal;
whence by land by the villages is but nine miles, but by
water at least 50. The country round the Osage villages is
one of the most beautiful the eye ever beheld. The three
branches of the river, viz.: the large east fork [Sac river],
the middle one [Little Osage], up which we ascended, and
the northern one [main Osage], all winding round and past
the villages, giving the advantages of wood and water, and
at the same time the extensive prairies crowned with rich
and luxuriant grass and flowers, gently diversified by the
rising swells and sloping lawns, present to the warm imagination
the future seats of husbandry, the numerous herds of
domestic animals, which are no doubt destined to crown
with joy those happy plains. The best comment I can
make on the navigation of the Osage river is a reference to
my chart and journal on that subject. From the last village
on the Missouri to the prairies on the Osage river we found
plenty of deer, bear, and some turkeys. Thence to the
towns there are some elk and deer, but near the villages
they become scarce.</p>

<p>From the Osage towns to the source of the [Little] Osage
river there is no difference in the appearance of the country,
except that on the south and east the view on the prairies
becomes unbounded, and is only limited by the imbecility
of our sight. The waters of the White [Neosho] river and
the [Little] Osage are divided merely by a small ridge in
the prairie, and the dry branches appear to interlock at their
head. From thence to the main branch of the said [Neosho]
river the country appeared high, with gravelly ridges of
prairie land. On the main White river is large timber and
fine ground for cultivation. Hence a doubt arises as to the
disemboguing of this stream. Lieutenant Wilkinson, from
some authority, has drawn the conclusion that it discharges
itself into the Arkansaw a short distance below the Vermilion
river; but from the voyages of Captain Maney
[Many] on White river, the information of hunters, Indians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">515</a></span>
etc., I am rather induced to believe it to be the White river of
the Mississippi, as at their mouths there is not so great a difference
between their magnitude; and all persons agree in
ascertaining [asserting] that the White river heads between
the Osage, Arkansaw, and Kansas rivers, which would still
leave the Arkansaw near 800 miles more lengthy than the
White river. From the proofs, I am perfectly confident in
asserting that this was the White river of the Mississippi
which we crossed.<a name="FNanchor_IV-3" id="FNanchor_IV-3" href="#Footnote_IV-3" class="fnanchor">[IV-3]</a> At the place where we traversed it, the
stream was amply navigable for canoes, even at this dry
season (August) of the year.</p>

<p>Up this river to the dividing ridges between it and the
Verdigrise river, the bottom is of some magnitude and
importance; but the latter river is bounded here in a narrow
bed of prairie hills, affording not more than sufficient timber
for firewood for a limited number of inhabitants for a few
years. From the Verdigrise our course again lay over
gravelly hills and a prairie country, but well watered by the
branches of the Verdigrise and White (alias Grand) rivers.
From this point to the source of White river there is very
little timber, the grass short, prairies high and dry. From
the head of White river over the dividing ridge between
that and the eastern [Smoky Hill] branch of the Kans
river, the ridge is high, dry, and has many appearances of
iron ore, and on the west side are some spaw springs [spas].
Here the country is very deficient of water. From the east
branch of the Kans river (by our route) to the Pawnee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">516</a></span>
Republic on the Republican fork (see chart), the prairies
are low, with high grass; the country abounds with salines,
and the earth appears to be impregnated with nitrous and
common salts. The immediate border of the Republican
fork near the village is high ridges, but this is an exception
to the general face of the country. All the country between
the forks of the Kans river, a distance of 160 miles, may be
called prairie, notwithstanding the borders of woodland
which ornament the banks of those streams, but are no
more than a line traced on a sheet of paper, when compared
to the immense tract of meadow country.</p>

<p>For some distance from the Osage villages you only find
deer, then elk, then cabrie, and finally buffalo. But it is
worthy of remark that although the male buffaloes were in
great abundance, yet in all our route from the Osage to the
Pawnees we never saw one female. I acknowledge myself
at a loss to determine whether this is to be attributed to
the decided preference the savages give to the meat of the
females, so that consequently they are almost exterminated
in the hunting-grounds of the nations, or to some physical
causes; for I afterward discovered the females with young
in such immense herds as gave me no reason to believe they
yielded to the males in numbers.</p>

<p>From the Pawnee town on the Kansas river to the Arkansaw,
the country may almost be termed mountainous; but
want of timber gives the hills less claim to the appellation
of mountains. They are watered and created, as it
were, by the various branches of the Kans river. One of
those branches, a stream of considerable magnitude (say 20
yards), which I have designated on the chart by the name
of Saline, was so salt, where we crossed it on our route to
the Arkansaw, that it salted sufficiently the soup of the
meat which my men boiled in it. We were here very
eligibly situated; had a fresh spring, issuing from a bank
near us; plenty of the necessaries of life all around, viz.:
buffalo; a beautiful little sugar-loaf hill, for a lookout post;
fine grass for our horses; and a saline in front of us.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a></span></p>

<p>As you approach the Arkansaw on this route within 15 or
20 miles, the country appears to be low and swampy; or
the land is covered with ponds extending out from the river
some distance. The river at the place where I struck it is
nearly 500 yards wide, from bank to bank, those banks not
more than four feet high, thinly covered with cottonwood.
The north side is a swampy low prairie [Cheyenne Bottoms],
and the south a sandy sterile desert. Thence, about halfway
to the mountains, the country continued with low
prairie hills, and scarcely any streams putting into the river;
and on the bottom are many bare spots on which, when the
sun is in the meridian, is congealed a species of salt sufficiently
thick to be accumulated, but so strongly impregnated
with nitric qualities as to render it unfit for use until purified.
The grass in this district, on the river bottoms, has
a great appearance of the grass on our salt marshes. From
the first south fork ([Purgatory river] see chart) the borders
of the river have more wood, and the hills are higher,
until you arrive at its entrance into the mountains. The
whole of the timber is cottonwood, from the entrance of the
Arkansaw into the mountains to its source, a distance of
about 170 miles by the meanders; it is alternately bounded
by perpendicular precipices and small, narrow prairies, on
which the buffalo and elk have found the means to arrive,
and are almost secure from danger from their destroyer&mdash;man.
In many places the river precipitates itself over
rocks, so as at one moment to be visible only in the foaming
and boiling of its waters&mdash;at the next moment it
disappears in the chasms of the overhanging precipices.</p>

<p>The Arkansaw<a name="FNanchor_IV-4" id="FNanchor_IV-4" href="#Footnote_IV-4" class="fnanchor">[IV-4]</a> river, taking its meanders agreeably to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">518</a></span>
Lieutenant Wilkinson's survey of the lower part, is 1,981
miles from its entrance into the Mississippi to the mountains,
and from thence to its source 192 miles, making its
total length 2,173 miles: all of which may be navigated
with proper boats, constructed for the purpose, except the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">519</a></span>
192 miles in the mountains. It has emptying into it several
small rivers navigable for 100 miles and upward. Boats
bound up the whole length of the navigation should embark
at its entrance on the 1st of February, when they would
have the fresh [high water] quite to the mountains, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">520</a></span>
meet with no detention. But if they should start later,
they would find the river 1,500 miles up nearly dry. It has
one singularity which struck me very forcibly at first view,
but which, on reflection, I am induced to believe is the same
case with all the rivers which run through a low, dry, sandy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">521</a></span>
soil in warm climates, as I observed it to be the case with
the Rio del Norte, viz.: for the extent of 400 or 500 miles
before you arrive near the mountains, the bed of the river
is extensive and a perfect sand-bar, which at certain seasons
is dry, or at least the water is standing in ponds not affording
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">522</a></span>
sufficient to procure a running course; but when you
come nearer the mountains you find the river contracted,
a gravelly bottom, and a deep, navigable stream. From
these circumstances it is evident that the sandy soil imbibes
all the [not evaporated] waters which the sources project
from the mountains, and renders the river in dry
seasons less navigable 500 than 200 miles from its source.</p>

<p>The borders of the Arkansaw river may be termed the terrestrial
paradise of our territories for the wandering savages.
Of all countries ever visited by the footsteps of civilized man,
there never was one probably that produced game in greater
abundance. We know that the manners and morals of the
erratic nations are such (the reasons I leave to be given by
the ontologists) as never to give them a numerous population;
and I believe that there are buffalo, elk, and deer
sufficient on the banks of the Arkansaw alone, if used without
waste, to feed all the savages in the United States territory
one century. By the route of the Arkansaw and the
Rio Colorado of California, I am confident in asserting, if
my information from Spanish gentlemen of information
is correct, there can be established the best communication,
on this side of the Isthmus of Darien, between the Atlantic
and Pacific oceans; as, admitting the utmost, the land carriage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">523</a></span>
would not be more than 200 miles, and the route may
be made quite as eligible as our public highways over the
Alleghany mountains. The Rio Colorado is to the great
Gulph of California what the Mississippi is to the Gulph of
Mexico, and is navigable for ships of considerable burden,
to opposite the upper parts of the province of Senora.</p>

<p>From the Arkansaw to the Rio del Norte, by the route
I passed, the country was covered with mountains and small
prairies, as per chart; but the game became much more
scarce, owing to the vicinity of the Spanish Indians and the
Spaniards themselves.</p>

<p>In this western traverse of Louisiana, the following
general observations may be made, viz.: that from the
Missouri to the head of the [Little] Osage river, a distance
in a straight line of probably 300 miles, the country will
admit of a numerous, extensive, and compact population;
thence, on the rivers Kanses, La Platte, Arkansaw, and
their various branches, it appears to me to be only possible
to introduce a limited population on their banks. The
inhabitants would find it most to their advantage to pay
attention to the multiplication of cattle, horses, sheep, and
goats, all of which they can raise in abundance, the earth
producing spontaneously sufficient for their support, both
winter and summer, by which means their herds might
become immensely numerous; but the wood now in the
country would not be sufficient for a moderate share of
population more than 15 years, and it would be out of
the question to think of using any of it in manufactures;
consequently, the houses would be built entirely of mud-brick
[adobe], like those in New Spain, or of the brick
manufactured with fire. But possibly time may make the
discovery of coal-mines, which would render the country
habitable.</p>

<p>The source of La Platte is situated in the same chain of
mountains with the Arkansaw (see chart), and comes from
that grand reservoir of snows and fountains which gives
birth on its northeastern side to the Red river of the Missouri
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">524</a></span>
(the yellow stone river of Lewis [and Clark], its great
southwestern branch), and La Platte; on its southwestern
side it produces the Rio Colorado of California; on its
east the Arkansaw; and on its south the Rio del Norte
of North Mexico. I have no hesitation in asserting that
I can take a position in the mountains, whence I can visit
the source of any of those rivers in one day.<a name="FNanchor_IV-5" id="FNanchor_IV-5" href="#Footnote_IV-5" class="fnanchor">[IV-5]</a></p>

<p>Numerous have been the hypotheses formed by various
naturalists to account for the vast tract of untimbered country
which lies between the waters of the Missouri, Mississippi,
and the Western Ocean, from the mouth of the latter river
to 48° north latitude. Although not flattering myself to be
able to elucidate that which numbers of highly scientific
characters have acknowledged to be beyond their depth of
research, still I would not think I had done my country
justice did I not give birth to what few lights my examination
of those internal deserts has enabled me to acquire.
In that vast country of which I speak, we find the soil
generally dry and sandy, with gravel, and discover that the
moment we approach a stream the land becomes more
humid, with small timber. I therefore conclude that this
country never was timbered; as, from the earliest age the
aridity of the soil, having so few water-courses running
through it, and they being principally dry in summer, has
never afforded moisture sufficient to support the growth of
timber. In all timbered land the annual discharge of the
leaves, with the continual decay of old trees and branches,
creates a manure and moisture, which is preserved from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">525</a></span>
heat of the sun not being permitted to direct his rays perpendicularly,
but only to shed them obliquely through the
foliage. But here a barren soil, parched and dried up for
eight months in the year, presents neither moisture nor nutrition
sufficient to nourish the timber. These vast plains of
the western hemisphere may become in time as celebrated
as the sandy deserts of Africa; for I saw in my route, in
various places, tracts of many leagues where the wind had
thrown up the sand in all the fanciful form of the ocean's
rolling wave, and on which not a speck of vegetable matter
existed.</p>

<p>But from these immense prairies may arise one great
advantage to the United States, viz.: The restriction of our
population to some certain limits, and thereby a continuation
of the Union. Our citizens being so prone to rambling
and extending themselves on the frontiers will, through
necessity, be constrained to limit their extent on the west
to the borders of the Missouri and Mississippi, while they
leave the prairies incapable of cultivation to the wandering
and uncivilized aborigines of the country.</p>

<p>The Osage appear to have emigrated from the north and
west; from their speaking the same language with the Kans,
Otos, Missouries, and Mahaws, together with their great
similarity of manners, morals, and customs, there is left no
room to doubt that they were originally the same nation,
but separated by that great law of nature, self-preservation,
the love of freedom, and the ambition of various characters,
so inherent in the breast of man. As nations purely erratic
must depend solely on the chase for subsistence, unless
pastoral, which is not the case with our savages, it requires
large tracts of country to afford subsistence for a very
limited number of souls; consequently, self-preservation
obliges them to expand themselves over a large and extensive
district. The power of certain chiefs becoming
unlimited, and their rule severe, added to the passionate
love of liberty and the ambition of young, bold, and daring
characters who step forward to head the malcontents, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">526</a></span>
like the tribes of Israel, to lead them through the wilderness
to a new land&mdash;the land of promise which flowed with milk
and honey, alias abounded with deer and buffalo&mdash;these
characters soon succeed in leading forth a new colony, and
in process of time establishing a new nation. The Mahaws,
Missouries, and Otos remained on the banks of the Missouri
river, such a distance up as to be in the reach of that
powerful enemy, the Sioux, who, with the aid of the smallpox,
which the former nations unfortunately contracted by
their connection with the whites, have reduced the Mahaws,
formerly a brave and powerful nation, to a mere cipher,
and obliged the Otos and Missouries to join their forces, so
that these now form but one nation. The Kanses and
Osage came further to the east, and thereby avoided the
Sioux, but fell into the hands of the Iowas, Sacs, Kickapous,
Potowatomies, Delawares, Shawanese, Cherokees,
Chickasaws, Chactaws, Arkansaws, Caddoes, and Tetaus;
and what astonished me extremely is that they have not
been entirely destroyed by those nations. But it must only
be attributed to their ignorance of the enemies' force, their
want of concert, wars between themselves, and the great
renown the invaders always acquire, by the boldness of their
enterprise, in the minds of the invaded.</p>

<p>Their government is oligarchical, but still partakes of the
nature of a republic; for, although the power nominally is
vested in a small number of chiefs, yet they never undertake
any matter of importance without first assembling the
warriors and proposing the subject in council, there to be
discussed and decided on by a majority. Their chiefs are
hereditary, in most instances, yet there are many men who
have risen to more influence than those of illustrious ancestry,
by their activity and boldness in war. Although there
is no regular code of laws, yet there is a tacit acknowledgment
of the right which some have to command on certain
occasions, whilst others are bound to obey, and even to
submit to corporeal punishment; as is instanced in the
affair related in my diary of <a href="#july29">July 29th</a>, when Has-ha-ke-da-tungar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">527</a></span>
or Big Soldier, whom I had made a partisan to regulate
the movements of the Indians, flogged a young Indian
with arms in his hands. On the whole, their government
may be termed an oligarchical republic, where the chiefs
propose and the people decide on all public acts.</p>

<p>The manners of the Osage are different from those of any
nation I ever saw except those before mentioned of the same
origin, having their people divided into classes. All the
bulk of the nation being warriors and hunters&mdash;with them
these terms being almost synonymous&mdash;the remainder is
divided into two classes, cooks and doctors; the latter of
whom likewise exercise the functions of priests or magicians,
and have great influence in the councils of the nation by
their pretended divinations, interpretations of dreams, and
magical performances. An illustration of this will be better
given by the following anecdote of what took place during
my stay at the nation, in August, 1806: Having had all the
doctors or magicians assembled in the lodge of Ca-ha-ga-tonga,
alias Cheveux Blancs, and about 500 spectators, they
had two rows of fires prepared, around which the sacred
band was stationed. They commenced the tragicomedy by
putting a large butcher-knife down their throats, the blood
appearing to run during the operation very naturally; the
scene was continued by putting sticks through the nose,
swallowing bones and taking them out of the nostrils, etc.
At length one fellow demanded of me what I would give if
he would run a stick through his tongue, and let another
person cut off the piece. I replied, "a shirt." He then apparently
performed his promise, with great pain, forcing a
stick through his tongue, and then giving a knife to a bystander,
who appeared to cut off the piece, which he held to
the light for the satisfaction of the audience, and then joined
it to his tongue, and by a magical charm healed the wound
immediately. On demanding of me what I thought of the
performance, I replied I would give him 20 shirts if he would
let me cut off the piece from his tongue; this disconcerted
him a great deal, and I was sorry I had made the observation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">528</a></span></p>

<p>The cooks are either for the general use, or attached particularly
to the family of some great man; and what is the
more singular, men who have been great warriors and brave
men, having lost all their families by disease, in the war, and
themselves becoming old and infirm, frequently take up the
profession of cook, in which they do not carry arms, and are
supported by the public or their particular patron.</p>

<p>They likewise exercise the functions of town criers, calling
the chiefs to council and to feasts; or if any particular
person is wanted, you employ a crier, who goes through the
village crying his name and informing him he is wanted at
such a lodge. When received into the Osage village you
immediately present yourself at the lodge of the chief, who
receives you as his guest, where you generally eat first, after
the old patriarchal style. You are then invited to a feast by
all the great men of the village, and it would be a great insult
if you did not comply, at least as far as to taste of their
victuals. In one instance, I was obliged to taste of 15 different
entertainments the same afternoon. You will hear
the cooks crying, "come and eat"&mdash;such an one "gives a
feast, come and eat of his bounty." Their dishes were generally
sweet corn boiled in buffalo grease, or boiled meat and
pumpkins; but San Oriel [Sans Oreille], alias Tetobasi,
treated me to a dish of tea in a wooden dish, with new horn
spoons, boiled meat, and crullers; he had been in the United
States. Their towns hold more people in the same space of
ground than any places I ever saw. Their lodges are posted
with scarcely any regularity, each one building in the manner,
directions, and dimensions which suit him best, by
which means they frequently leave only room for a single
man to squeeze between them; added to this, they have
pens for their horses, all within the village, into which they
always drive them at night, in case they think there is any
reason to believe there is an enemy lurking in the vicinity.</p>

<p>The Osage lodges are generally constructed with upright
posts, put firmly in the ground, of about 20 feet in height,
with a crotch at the top; they are about 12 feet distant from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">529</a></span>
each other; in the crotch of those posts are put the ridge-poles,
over which are bent small poles, the ends of which are
brought down and fastened to a row of stakes about five
feet in height; these stakes are fastened together with three
horizontal bars, and form the flank walls of the lodge. The
gable ends are generally broad slabs, rounded off to the
ridge-pole. The whole of the building and sides are covered
with matting made of rushes, two or three feet in
length and four feet in width, which are joined together, and
entirely exclude the rain. The doors are on the sides of the
building, and generally are one on each side. The fires are
made in holes in the center of the lodge, the smoke ascending
through apertures left in the roof for the purpose. At
one end of the dwelling is a raised platform, about three feet
from the ground, which is covered with bear-skins, generally
holds all the little choice furniture of the master, and on
which repose his honorable guests. In fact, with neatness
and a pleasing companion, these dwellings would compose
a very comfortable and pleasant summer habitation, but are
left in the winter for the woods. They vary in length from
36 to 100 feet.</p>

<p>The Osage nation is divided into three villages, and in a
few years you may say nations, viz.: the Grand Osage, the
Little Osage, and those of the Arkansaw.</p>

<p>The Little Osage separated from the Big Osage about 100
years since, when their chiefs, on obtaining permission to
lead forth a colony from the great council of the nation,
moved on to the Missouri; but after some years, finding
themselves too hard pressed by their enemies, they again
obtained permission to return, put themselves under the
protection of the Grand village, and settled down about six
miles off. (See chart.)</p>

<p>The Arkansaw schism was effected by Mr. Pierre Choteau,
10 or 12 years ago, as a revenge on Mr. Manuel De Sezei
[Liza or Lisa], who had obtained from the Spanish government
the exclusive trade of the Osage nation, by the way of
the Osage river, after it had been in the hands of Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">530</a></span>
Choteau for nearly 20 years. The latter, having the trade of
the Arkansaw, thereby nearly rendered abortive the exclusive
privilege of his rival. He has been vainly promising to
the government that he would bring them back to join the
Grand village. But his reception at the Arkansaw village,
in the autumn of 1806, must have nearly cured him of that
idea. And in fact, every reason induces a belief that the
other villages are much more likely to join the Arkansaw
band, which is daily becoming more powerful, than the latter
is to return to its ancient residence. For the Grand and
Little Osage are both obliged to proceed to the Arkansaw
every winter, to kill the summer's provision; also, all the
nations with whom they are now at war are situated to the
westward of that river, whence they get all their horses.
These inducements are such that the young, the bold, and
the enterprising are daily emigrating from the Osage village
to the Arkansaw village. In fact, it would become the interest
of our government to encourage that emigration, if
we intend to encourage the extension of the settlement of
Upper Louisiana; but if the contrary (our true policy),
every method should be taken to prevent their elongation
from the Missouri.</p>

<p>They are considered by the nations to the south and west
of them as a brave and warlike nation; but are by no means
a match for the northern nations, who make use of the rifle,
and can combat them two for one; whilst they again may
fight those armed with bows, arrows, and lances, at the same
disproportion.</p>

<p>The humane policy which the United States have held
forth to the Indian nations, of accommodating their differences
and acting as mediators between them, has succeeded
to a miracle with the Osage of the Grand village and the
Little Osage. In short, they have become a nation of
Quakers, as respects the nations to the north and east of
them, at the same time that they continue to make war on
the naked and defenseless savages of the west. An instance
of their forbearance was exhibited in an attack made on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">531</a></span>
hunting-party of the Little Osage, in the autumn of 1808, on
the grand river of the Osage, by a party of the Potowatomies,
who crossed the Missouri river by the Saline, and
found the women and children alone and defenseless. The
men, 50 or 60, having found plenty of deer the day before,
had encamped out all night. The enemy struck the camp
about ten o'clock in the morning, killed all the women and
boys who made resistance, also some infants, the whole
number amounting to 34; and led into captivity near 60, 46
of whom were afterward recovered by the United States
and sent under my protection to the village. When the men
returned to camp, they found their families all destroyed
or taken prisoners. My narrator had his wife and four children
killed on the spot; yet, in obedience to the injunctions
of their great father, they forebore to revenge the blow.</p>

<p>As an instance of the great influence the French formerly
had over this nation, the following anecdote may be interesting:
Chtoka, alias Wet Stone, a Little Osage, said he
"was at Braddock's defeat, with all the warriors who could
be spared from both villages; that they were engaged by Mr.
M'Cartie, who commanded at Fort Chartres,<a name="FNanchor_IV-6" id="FNanchor_IV-6" href="#Footnote_IV-6" class="fnanchor">[IV-6]</a> and who supplied
them with powder and ball; that the place of rendezvous
was near a lake and large fall (supposed to be Niagara);
the Kans did not arrive until after the battle; but the Otos
were present. They were absent from their villages seven
months, and were obliged to eat their horses on their return."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">532</a></span></p>

<p>The Osage raise large quantities of corn, beans, and pumpkins,
which they manage with the greatest economy, in
order to make them last from year to year. All the agricultural
labor is done by women.</p>

<p>If the government think it expedient to establish factories
for the Grand and Little villages, equidistant from both,
which would answer for the Grand and Little villages, the
other establishment should be on the Arkansaw, near the
entrance of the Verdigrise river, for the Arkansaw Osage, as
stated by Lieutenant Wilkinson.</p>

<p>The Pawnees are a numerous nation of Indians, who
reside on the rivers Platte and Kans. They are divided
into three distinct nations, two of them being now at war;
but their manners, language, customs, and improvements
are in the same degree of advancement. On La Platte
reside the Grand Pawnees, and on one of its branches the
Pawnee Loups, with whom the Pawnee Republicans are at
war. [See <a href="#Footnote_I-73">note<sup>73</sup>, p. 412</a>.]</p>

<p>Their language is guttural, and approaches nearer to the
language of the Sioux than the Osage; and their figure, tall,
slim, with high cheek-bones, clearly indicates their Asiatic
origin. But their emigration south, and the ease with which
they live on the buffalo plains, have probably been the cause
of a degeneracy of manners, for they are neither so brave nor
so honest as their more northern neighbors. Their government
is the same as the Osages', an hereditary aristocracy,
the father handing his dignity of chieftain down to his son;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">533</a></span>
but their power is extremely limited, notwithstanding the
long life they have to establish their authority and influence.
They merely recommend and give council in the great assemblage
of the nation.</p>

<p>They are not so cleanly, neither do they carry their internal
policy so far as, the Osage; but out of the bounds of the
village it appeared to me that they exceeded them; as I
have frequently seen two young soldiers come out to my
camp and instantly disperse a hundred persons, by the
strokes of long whips, who were assembled there to trade
with my men. In point of cultivation [agriculture], they are
about equal to the Osage, raising a sufficiency of corn and
pumpkins to afford a little thickening to their soup during
the year. The pumpkin they cut into thin slices and dry in
the sun, which reduces it to a small size, and not more than
a tenth of its original weight.</p>

<p>With respect to raising horses, the Pawnees are far superior
to the Osage, having vast quantities of excellent horses
which they are daily increasing, by their attention to their
breeding mares, which they never make use of; and in addition
they frequently purchase from the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Their houses are a perfect circle, except where the door
enters, whence there is a projection of about 15 feet; the
whole being constructed after the following manner: First,
there is an excavation of a circular form made in the ground,
about 4 feet deep and 60 in diameter, where there is a row
of posts about 5 feet high, with crotches at the top, set
firmly in all round, and horizontal poles from one to the
other. There is then a row of posts, forming a circle about
10 feet wide in the diameter of the others, and 10 feet
in height; the crotches of these are so directed that horizontal
poles are also laid from one to the other; long poles
are then laid slanting upward from the lower poles over
the higher ones, and meeting nearly at the top, leaving only
a small aperture for the smoke of the fire to pass out, which
is made on the ground in the middle of the lodge. There is
then a number of small poles put up around the circle, so as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">534</a></span>
to form the wall, and wicker-work is run through the whole.
The roof is then thatched with grass, and earth is thrown up
against the wall until a bank is made to the eaves of the
thatch; that is also filled with earth one or two feet thick,
and rendered so tight as entirely to exclude any storm,
and make the houses extremely warm. The entrance is
about six feet wide, with walls on each side, and roofed like
our houses in shape, but of the same materials as the main
building. Inside there are numerous little apartments constructed
of wicker-work against the wall, with small doors;
they have a great appearance of neatness, and in them the
members of the family sleep and have their little deposits.
Their towns are by no means so much crowded as the Osage,
giving much more space; but they have the same mode of
introducing their horses into the village at night, which
makes it extremely crowded. They keep guards with the
horses during the day.</p>

<p>They are extremely addicted to gaming, and have for that
purpose a smooth piece of ground cleared out on each side
of the village for about 150 yards in length, on which they
play the three following games: One is played by two
players at a time, and in the following manner: They have
a large hoop about four feet in diameter, in the center of
which is a small leather ring; this is attached to leather
thongs which are extended to the hoop, and by that means
kept in its central position; they also have a pole about six
feet in length, which the player holds in one hand; he then
rolls the hoop from him, and immediately slides the pole
after it; and the nearer the head of the pole lies to the
small ring within the hoop, when they both fall, the greater
is the cast. But I could not ascertain their mode of counting
sufficiently to decide when the game was won. Another
game is played with a small stick, with several hooks, and a
hoop about four inches in diameter, which is rolled along
the ground, and the forked stick darted after it, the value
of the cast being estimated by the hook on which the ring
is caught. This game is gained at 100. The third game
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">535</a></span>
alluded to is that of la platte, described by various travelers
[as the platter or dish game]; this is played by the women,
children, and old men, who, like grasshoppers, crawl out to
the circus to bask in the sun, probably covered only with an
old buffalo robe.</p>

<p>The Pawnees, like the Osage, quit their villages in the
winter, making concealments under ground of their corn, in
which [caches] it keeps perfectly sound until spring. The
only nations with whom the Pawnees are now at war are the
Tetaus, Utahs, and Kyaways. The two latter of these reside
in the mountains of North Mexico, and shall be treated
when I speak of the Spanish Indians. The former generally
inhabit the borders of the Upper Red river, Arkansaw,
and Rio del Norte. The war has been carried on by
those nations for years, without any decisive action being
fought, although they frequently march with 200 or 300 men.</p>

<p>The Pawnees have much the advantage of their enemies
in point of arms, at least one-half having firearms, whilst
their opponents have only bows, arrows, lances, shields, and
slings. The Pawnees always march to war on foot; their
enemies are all cavalry. This nation may be considered as
the one equidistant between the Spanish population and that
of our settlements in Louisiana, but are at present decidedly
under Spanish influence, and, should a war commence to-morrow,
would all be in their interest. This circumstance
does not arise from their local situation, because they are all
situated on navigable waters of the Missouri; nor from their
interest, because from the Spaniards they obtain nothing except
horses and a few coarse blankets of W. Mexico; whilst
from us they receive all their supplies of arms, ammunition,
and clothing&mdash;but all those articles in very small quantities,
not more than half having blankets, and many being without
breech-cloths to cover their nakedness. But the grand
principle by which the Spaniards keep them in their influence
is fear, frequently chastising their small parties on
the frontiers. Their sending out the detachment of 600
horsemen, in 1806, has made such an impression that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">536</a></span>
Spaniards may safely calculate on the Pawnees in case of
war. This detachment took with them some of the Pawnees
to Chihuahua, at the same time that I entered the Spanish
provinces. But, by our withholding their supplies of arms,
ammunition, and clothing for one or two years, bringing on
their backs the Osage and Kans, the Pawnees would be in
great distress, and feel the necessity of a good understanding
with the United States.</p>

<p>If there should ever be factories established for their accommodation,
these should be at the entrances of La Platte
and Kans rivers, as those waters are of so uncertain navigation
(only in freshets) that it would be folly to attempt any
permanent establishments high up them; and to make those
establishments useful to the Pawnees, we must presuppose
our influence sufficient to guarantee them peace and a safe
passage through the nations of the Kans, Otos, and Missouries&mdash;the
former on the Kans river, the two latter on
the river Platte. My journal will give various other striking
traits of the national character of the Pawnees, and my
dissertation on the subject of the Spanish claims will further
elucidate the political and relative situation of that nation.</p>

<p>The Kans are a small nation, situated on a river of that
name (see the chart), and are in language, manners, customs,
and agricultural pursuits, precisely similar to the Osage;
with whom I believe them, as before observed, to have had
one common origin. It may be said, however, that their
language differs in some degree, but not more than the
dialect of our Eastern States differs from that of the Southern.
But in war they are yet more brave than their Osage
brethren; being, although not more than one-third of their
number, their most dreaded enemies, and frequently making
the Pawnees tremble.</p>

<p>The Tetaus, or Camanches as the Spaniards term them,
[called] Padoucas by the Pawnees, are a powerful nation
who are entirely erratic, without the least species of cultivation,
and subsist solely by the chase. But their wanderings
are confined to the frontiers of New Mexico on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">537</a></span>
W., to the nations on the Lower Red river on the S., to the
Pawnees and Osage on the E., and to the Utahs, Kyaways,
and various unknown nations on the N. This nation,
although entirely in our territories, is claimed exclusively
by the Spaniards, and may be said to be decidedly in
their interest, notwithstanding the few who lately paid a
visit to Natchitoches.</p>

<p>They are the only nation bordering on the Spanish settlements
whom that nation treats as an independent people.
They are by the Spaniards reputed brave&mdash;indeed, they
have given some very strong evidences of this; for when I
first entered the province of New Mexico, I was shown
various deserted villages and towns beaten down, which had
been destroyed by the Tetaus in an invasion of that province,
when they were at war with the Spaniards about ten
years since.</p>

<p>From the village of Agua Caliente (see chart) they carried
off at one time 2,000 head of horses; but they now have
an excellent understanding with the Spaniards, which Don
Facundo Malagare's [Malgares'] late expedition has served
very much to increase. He personally related his rencounter
with the Tetaus in the following manner: Having been
personally apprised of each other's approximation, and
appointed a time for the Indians to receive him on an
extensive prairie, he sallied forth from his camp with 500
men, all on white horses, excepting himself and his two
principal officers, who rode jet black ones, and was received
on the plain by 1,500 of the savages, dressed in their gay
robes, and displaying their various feats of chivalry. I leave
this subject to the judicious, whether the circumstance
would not be handed down to the latest posterity as an
instance of the good will and respect which the Spaniards
paid their nation, as no doubt Malgares had policy sufficient
to induce them to believe that the expedition was principally
fitted out with a view to pay them a visit. As I
was not in their country, and did not meet with any of the
wandering parties, I shall not attempt to describe their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">538</a></span>
manners and customs; but in my <a href="#Page_590">statistical tables</a> I shall
include them, agreeably to the best information obtained of
their nation.</p>

<p>I shall here conclude my account of the nations with whom
I became acquainted in our boundaries; as I conceive the
Spanish Indians require a different discussion and attention
from a different point of view, as their missionaries have
succeeded with them beyond what we can form an idea
of. My diary will present numerous additional circumstances,
to form an idea of those savages, their manners,
customs, principles, and biases, political and local.</p>

<br />
<span class="s08">WILKINSON'S REPORT ON THE ARKANSAW.<a name="FNanchor_V-1" id="FNanchor_V-1" href="#Footnote_V-1" class="fnanchor">[V-1]</a></span></h2>

<p class="left25">New Orleans, April 6th, 1807.</p>

<p>Sir: Agreeably to your order dated in June, 1806, I took
my departure from Belle Fontaine, under the command
of Lieutenant Pike, early in July [15th]. The Missouri
being well up, we found the navigation as favorable as could
have been expected. On the 28th of the same month we
reached the mouth of the Osage river, which we found
a pellucid, tranquil stream, with the exception of a few
trifling ripples, and a fall of about six feet in two-thirds of
a mile, called the Old Man's Rapid. The river abounds
with various kinds of good fish, especially the soft-shelled
turtle [<i>Trionyx</i> or <i>Aspidonectes ferox</i>], which we took in
great numbers. The banks of the river are generally formed
by craggy cliffs, and not unfrequently you perceive stupendous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">540</a></span>
rocks projecting over the water, out of which issue
excellent springs. The most remarkable natural curiosity
which I observed is a pond of water, about 300 toises<a name="FNanchor_V-2" id="FNanchor_V-2" href="#Footnote_V-2" class="fnanchor">[V-2]</a> in
circumference, six miles above the Yanga [Yungar, Nehemgar,
or Niangua river], on a rising piece of ground, considerably
above the level of the river, which keeps one continued
height, is perfectly pure and transparent, and has no
outlet by which to discharge.</p>

<p>On the 12th of August the Osages appeared dissatisfied
with the tedious movement of our barges, and expressed
a wish to cross the prairie to their villages, in case an escort
were allowed them. I immediately volunteered my services,
and we parted with the boats at the mouth of Grand river
[the branch of the Osage], the spot where our ransomed
prisoners were taken the preceding winter by the Potowatomies.
We reached the village of the Little Osages after
a fatiguing and laborious march of six days across an arid
prairie.</p>

<p>When within a mile of the town, the chief Tuttasuggy,
or Wind, desired that a regular procession might be observed;
he accordingly placed me between himself and his
first warrior, and the ransomed captives followed by files.
Half a mile from the village we were met by 180 horsemen,
painted and decorated in a very fanciful manner; they
were considered as a guard of honor, and on our approach
opened to the right and left, leaving a sufficient space for
us to pass through. A few yards in advance, on the right,
I perceived 60 or more horsemen painted with blue chalk;
when the chief observed them, he commanded a halt, and
sent forward his younger brother Nezuma, or Rain that
Walks, with a flag and silk handkerchief as a prize for the
swiftest horseman. At a given signal they started off at
full speed, the two foremost taking the flag and handkerchief,
and the rest contenting themselves with having shown
their agility and skill. As I entered the village I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">541</a></span>
saluted by a discharge from four swivels which the Indians
had taken from an old fort [Fort Carondelet: see <a href="#Footnote_I-41">note<sup>41</sup>,
p. 384</a>] erected by the Spaniards on the river, and passed
through a crowd of nearly a thousand persons, part of
whom I learned were of the Grand village. I was immediately,
but with ceremony, ushered into the lodge of
Soldier of the Oak, who, after having paid me some very
handsome compliments, courteously invited me to eat of
green corn, buffalo-meat, and water-melons about the size
of a 24-pound shot, which, though small, were highly
flavored.</p>

<p>After Lieutenant Pike's arrival with the boats, we formed
our camp on the bank of the river, equidistant from the
villages of the Grand and Little Osages, and he selected
a situation for making his observations, which he did not
complete until the 28th of the month. The 29th and 30th
were devoted to packing as conveniently and carefully as
possible the mathematical instruments and a small quantity
of provisions. On the 1st of September we commenced our
march for the Pawnee Republic, and entered on that vast
and extensive prairie which lies between the Missouri and
the Rio del Norte.</p>

<p>We coursed the [Little] Osage river to its source, and
almost immediately crossed some of the small branches of
Grand [Neosho] river, which enters the Arkansaw about
700 miles from the Mississippi. After passing Grand river,
which we found to be 60 or 80 yards wide, we marched
a whole day [week<a name="FNanchor_V-3" id="FNanchor_V-3" href="#Footnote_V-3" class="fnanchor">[V-3]</a>] before we reached the waters of the
Kansas, and were agreeably surprised to find ourselves on
the bank of a bold running stream [Smoky Hill fork].
Between this and the village of the Pawnees we crossed
two strongly impregnated salines. We then passed over
a sandy country almost destitute of herbage; and after
a painful march under an oppressive sun, over an irregular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">542</a></span>
and broken surface, we arrived at the town of the Republican
Pawnees on the 25th of September.</p>

<p>We the day before were met by a number of warriors
whom curiosity had led thus far to see us, among whom
was the third consequential character of the Republican
party; for you must know that the village is composed of
the followers of a dissatisfied warrior who first made this
establishment, and the adherents of a regular chief of the
Grand Pawnees who migrated thither some few years since
with his family, and usurped the power of the Republican
warrior. To such a pitch does this party spirit prevail that
you easily perceive the hostility which exists between the
adherents of the two chiefs.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 25th we were joined by
a few more savages of distinction, headed by the brother of
Characterish, or White Wolf, chief of the nation, who was
to act as master of the ceremonies to our formal entry.
Preparatory to our march, we had our men equipped as
neatly as circumstances would admit. About mid-day we
reached the summit of a lofty chain of ridges, where we
were requested to halt and await the arrival of the chief,
who was half a mile from us, with 300 horsemen, who were
generally naked, except buffalo robes and breech cloths,
and painted with white, yellow, blue, and black paint. At
the word of the chief the warriors divided, and, pushing on
at full speed, flanked us on the right and left, yelling in
a most diabolical manner. The chief advanced in front,
accompanied by Iskatappe, or Rich Man, the second great
personage of the village and his two sons, who were clothed
in scarlet cloth. They approached slowly, and when within
100 yards the three latter halted; Characterish advanced in
great state, and when within a few paces of us stretched out
his hand and cried, "<i>Bon jour</i>." Thus ended the first ceremony.
We moved on about a mile further, and having
gained the summit of a considerable hill, we discovered the
village directly at its base. We here were again halted, and
the few Osages who accompanied us were ordered in front
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">543</a></span>
and seated in rank entire. The chief squatted on his hams
in front of them and filled a calumet, which several different
Indians took from him and handed the Osages to smoke.
This was called the horse-smoke, as each person who took
the pipe from the chief intended to present the Osages
a horse. Mr. Pike and Dr. Robinson afterward accompanied
the chief to his lodge, and I moved on with the
detachment and formed our camp on the opposite bank of
the Republican fork of the Kansas river, on a commanding
hill which had been selected as the most favorable situation
for making observations, though very inconvenient on
account of wood and water, which we had to transport
nearly a quarter of a mile.</p>

<p>At a council held some few days after our arrival, Lieutenant
Pike explained to them the difference of their present
situation and that of a few years past; that now they must
look up to the president of the United States as their great
father; that he [Pike] had been sent by him [Jefferson] to
assure them of his good wishes, etc.; that he perceived a
Spanish flag flying at the council-lodge door, and was anxious
to exchange one of their great father's for it; and that it
was our intention to proceed further to the westward, to
examine this, our newly acquired country. To this a singular
and extraordinary response was given&mdash;in fact, an objection
started in direct opposition to our proceeding further
west; however, they gave up the Spanish flag, and we had
the pleasure to see the American standard hoisted in its
stead.</p>

<p>At the same council Characterish observed that a large
body of Spaniards had lately been at his village, and that
they promised to return and build a town adjoining his.
The Spanish chief, he said, mentioned that he was not empowered
to council with him; that he came merely to break
the road for his master, who would visit him in the spring
with a large army; that he further told him the Americans
were a little people, but were enterprising, and one of those
days would stretch themselves even to his town; that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">544</a></span>
took the lands of Indians, and would drive off their game;
"and how very truly," said Characterish, "has the Spanish
chieftain spoken!" We demanded to purchase a few
horses, which was prohibited, and the friendly communication
which had existed between the town and our camp
was stopped. The conduct of our neighbors assumed a mysterious
change; our guards were several times alarmed, and
finally appearances became so menacing as to make it necessary
for us to be on our guard day and night.</p>

<p>It was obvious that the body of Spaniards, who preceded
us but a few weeks in their mission to this village, were the
regular cavalry and infantry of the province of Santa Fee, as
they had formed their camps in regular order; also we were
informed they kept regular guards, and that the beats of
their drum were uniform morning and evening. The Spanish
leader, further, delivered to Characterish a grand medal,
two mules, and a commission bearing the signature of the
governor, civil and military, of Santa Fee. He also had
similar marks of distinction for the Grand Pawnees, the Pawnee
Mahaws, Mahaws Proper, Otos, and Kanses.</p>

<p>On the 6th of October we made some few purchases of
miserable horses at the most exorbitant prices, and on the
7th, unmoved by the threats of the chief relative to our proceeding
further to the west, we marched in a close and compact
body until we passed their village, and took the large
beaten Spanish trace for the Arkansaw river. We passed
the following day [8th] an encampment of the Spaniards,
where we counted 69 fires. On the 9th, as usual, made an
easy march; and about noon, when we halted to refresh ourselves,
were overtaken by 300 Pawnees, on their way to the
salines of the Kanses to hunt buffalo. Their every act
showed a strong disposition to quarrel, and in fact they
seemed to court hostility; but, finding us without fear and
prepared, to a man, they offered no outrage. Having
grazed our horses an hour, we parted from this turbulent
band, slung our packs, proceeded to Solomon's Fork of the
Kanses, and pitched our tents on an old encampment of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">545</a></span>
Spaniards whose trace we were following, as we found the
next morning [10th] many tent-pins made of wood different
from any in that country. At mid-day Lieutenant Pike, Dr.
Robinson, and the interpreter Baroney pushed on to search
for water, and I remained with the troops. I pushed on as
briskly as our poor half-famished horses would permit, but
at nightfall could discover nothing of Mr. Pike, and had not
a tree in view. This induced me to quicken my pace; and,
as darkness had rendered my compass useless, I coursed by
the polar star; but the horizon becoming overcast, I halted
on a naked stony prairie, without water or grass for our
horses. On the following morning [11th] I directed my
course more to the southward, and about ten o'clock came
to the [which?] creek and encampment of Lieut. Pike. Late
in the evening of the same day [11th], after passing over a
mountainous tract of country, we reached the Grand Saline,
which we found so strongly impregnated as to render unpalatable
corn boiled in it. On the 12th, after a distressing
day's march, we reached the Second or Small Saline, and
on the following day [13th] encamped on the most western
[Smoky Hill] branch of the Kanses river.<a name="FNanchor_V-4" id="FNanchor_V-4" href="#Footnote_V-4" class="fnanchor">[V-4]</a></p>

<p>We were detained, on the morning of the 13th [14th], by
a small rain; but as time was pressing, we marched about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">546</a></span>
noon, crossed the dividing ridge of the Kanses and Arkansaw
rivers, and halted on a small branch of the latter. For several
days past we had been so bewildered by buffalo paths
that we lost the Spanish trace; and this being an object of
moment, we resolved to make search for it. Accordingly,
on the following day [15th] at noon, Mr. Pike and Dr. Robinson
struck off from the party on a due west course, and I
marched the detachment for a copse of wood which we could
barely discern in the southwest, and reached it about midnight.
At day-break I was awakened by my old and faithful
Osage, who informed me that we were on the banks of
the Arkansaw river. I immediately arose, and discovered
my tent to have been pitched on the margin of a water-course
nearly 400 yards wide, with banks not three feet high,
and a stream of water running through it about 20 feet in
width and not more than six or eight inches deep.</p>

<p>I remained here four days in great anxiety and suspense,
as neither Mr. Pike nor Dr. Robinson made their appearance,
nor could be found, although I had all my hunters out
in search of them. But I was agreeably surprised on the
fifth<a name="FNanchor_V-5" id="FNanchor_V-5" href="#Footnote_V-5" class="fnanchor">[V-5]</a> day, early in the morning, by their arrival. It appeared
that our apprehensions were mutual, as they expected I had
been cut off, and I believed they had been murdered.</p>

<p>On the 17th it commenced raining and continued for several
days, during which time the river rose so much as to
fill its bed from bank to bank. Lieutenant Pike having determined
that I should descend the Arkansaw, we cut down
a small green Cottonwood, and with much labor split out a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">547</a></span>
canoe, which being insufficient, we formed a second of buffalo
and elk skins.</p>

<p>After the rain had ceased the weather became extremely
cold, and on the 27th, in the evening, a severe snow-storm
commenced and continued nearly all night. In the morning
[of the 28th<a name="FNanchor_V-6" id="FNanchor_V-6" href="#Footnote_V-6" class="fnanchor">[V-6]</a>] the river was almost choked with drifting ice;
but the sun bursting out at noon, the ice disappeared, and I
took leave of Mr. Pike, who marched up the river at the moment
I embarked on board my newly constructed canoe.
Unfortunately, we had not proceeded more than 100 yards
when my boats grounded, and the men were obliged to drag
them through sand and ice five miles, to a copse of woods
on the southwestern bank. I here hauled up my canoe,
formed a kind of cabin of it, and wrapped myself up in my
buffalo-robe, disheartened and dissatisfied with the commencement
of my voyage. The night was severely cold,
and in the morning [29th] the river was so full of ice as to
prevent all possibility of proceeding. The day continued
stormy, with snow from the northwest.</p>

<p>On the 30th the river was frozen up, and toward evening
the water had run off and left the bed of the river covered
with ice. This circumstance determined me to leave my
canoes and course the river by land. Accordingly, on the
31st of October, after having thrown away all my clothing
and provision, except half a dozen tin cups of hard corn for
each man, I slung my rifle on my shoulder, and with my
buffalo-robe at my back and circumferentor in my hand, I
recommenced my march with a light and cheerful heart. My
only apprehension was that I might meet with detached
bands of the Pawnees, who, I am confident, would have
brought me and my five men [Ballenger, Boley, Bradley,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">548</a></span>
Huddleston, Wilson] to action; and what the consequence
of this would have been is very obvious.</p>

<p>On the 1st, 2d, and 3d of November I marched over high
and barren hills of sand; at the close of each day passed
strongly impregnated salines, and perceived the shores of
the river to be completely frosted with nitre. The face of
the country, as I descended, looked more desolate than
above, the eye being scarcely able to discern a tree; and if
one was discovered, it proved to be a solitary cottonwood,
stinted in growth by the sterility of the soil. The evening
of the 3d instant I encamped on the bank of the river, without
a tree or even a shrub in view. On the 4th we experienced
a heavy rain; but hunger and cold pressed me forward.
After marching 10 miles I reached a small tree, where I remained
in a continued rain for two days [5th, 6th], at the
expiration of which time, having exhausted my fuel, I had
again [7th] to push off in a severe storm, and formed my
camp at the mouth of a bold running stream [probably Cow
creek<a name="FNanchor_V-7" id="FNanchor_V-7" href="#Footnote_V-7" class="fnanchor">[V-7]</a>], whose northern bank was skirted by a chain of lofty
ridges.</p>

<p>On the 8th, in the morning, it having cleared up, I began
my march early, and it appeared as if we had just gotten
into the region of game; for the herds of buffalo, elk, goat
[antelope], and deer surpassed credibility. I do solemnly
assert that, if I saw one, I saw more than 9,000 buffaloes
during the day's march.</p>

<p>On the 10th, in the evening, after a severe day's march, I
encamped on the bank of a large creek [probably Little
Arkansaw<a href="#Footnote_V-7" class="fnanchor">[V-8]</a>], and discovered for the first time on the river a
species of wood differing from the cotton tree. I assure you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">549</a></span>
the sight was more agreeable than a person would imagine;
it was like meeting with an old acquaintance from whom I
had been separated a length of time. I even began to think
myself approximating civilized settlements, although I was
just entering on the hunting-ground of the Osages.</p>

<p>The buffaloes and goats disappeared on the 12th, or
rather we had passed their range and entered that of the
deer only. Our marches were through rich narrow bottoms
from 150 to 200 yards wide.</p>

<p>On the 15th, discovering timber sufficiently large to form
canoes, I felled a couple of trees, and commenced splitting
out. I would have proceeded further by land, but as my
men were almost worn out with fatigue, and as the game
grew scarce, I conceived it most advisable to rest for a short
time, and kill my winter's store of meat. This I effected
by the 24th, and on the same day completed the canoes.
On the 25th I again attempted the navigation of the river,
but was as unfortunate as at first; for my boat grounded,
after floating a few hundred yards, and the men were consequently
compelled to ply with their shoulders instead of
their paddles.</p>

<p>The following day I passed the Negracka [read Ninnescah<a name="FNanchor_V-9" id="FNanchor_V-9" href="#Footnote_V-9" class="fnanchor">[V-9]</a>],
at whose mouth commence the craggy cliffs which
line a great part of the shores of the Arkansaw.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">550</a></span></p>

<p>On the 28th the provision canoe overset, and I lost nearly
all my stock of meat; this accident was rendered the more
distressing by an almost total loss of my ammunition, which
unfortunately was in the same canoe.</p>

<p>On the 30th, I fell in with a band of Grand Osages, who
were in pursuit of buffalo cows; the chief of the party
insisted on my remaining with him a day, and sent out his
young men to hunt for me. In the afternoon two Indians
of the Osage nation joined us, with a horse and mule, and
brought me a message from Tuttasuggy, or Wind, who it
appeared was lying very ill, about 20 miles across the
prairie, and wished to see me. As he was a particular
favorite of mine, I left my canoes in charge of the men,
and passed with a guide to the chief's temporary village.
I found him extremely unwell, with what I conceived to be
a dropsy, for his abdomen was very much swollen. He
seemed gratified at the sight of me, and observed that he
was poor and pitiful, for the reason that he was a friend to
the Americans. He said that Chouteau, upon arrival at
their villages last fall, had treated him like a child; had
taken on to Washington his younger brother Nezuma, or
Rain that Walks, and intended making him [Nezuma] chief
of the nation; that Chouteau told him he [Tuttasuggy]
was a "bad man," and an "American" [<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, a friend of
the Americans]; that the Spaniards were going to war with
America, and in a short time would claim all this country
again; and that he [Chouteau] prevented the traders from
allowing credit, whereby his [Tuttasuggy's] family were
much distressed&mdash;as I clearly perceived, for they were even
destitute of a whole blanket.</p>

<p>This Nezuma, whom Chouteau took on to Washington
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">551</a></span>
last fall with his wife, I am better acquainted with than perhaps
Mr. Chouteau himself. In the first place, I marched
with him from St. Louis to his town, and he started with us
to visit the Pawnees; but the mean and pitiful wretch got
alarmed and sneaked off without even advising us of his
departure. He has no more command in the village than
a child, is no warrior, and has not even the power to control
the will of a single man of his nation. Whether this youth
is entitled to a grand medal, you may judge from the
foregoing statement. Indeed, Sir, our grand medals have
become so common that they do not carry with them the
respect which they should. I recollect that one of the
deputation who was at the seat of government, the year
before last, came out with a large medal and an intermediate-sized
one. On our arrival at the villages, I calculated on
his acting a conspicuous part; but, to my utter astonishment,
he was not permitted to sit among the chiefs, or even
the warriors, at the council.</p>

<p>You well know, Sir, how particular the Spaniards, and
the British especially, have been in their distribution of
medals; and if I mistake not, an Iowa chief, who had been
to the seat of government and there received a small medal,
returned it in preference to giving up a large British medal
which he valued more, because it was a certain distinguishing
mark of a chief.</p>

<p>You gave to Mr. Pike an intermediate-sized medal for one
of the Pawnee chiefs; this he presented to Iskatappe, who,
having remarked the medals pendent from the necks of the
two Pawnee young men who had been to Washington,
demanded of what utility it would be to him. The only
Spanish medals in the Pawnee nation are those worn by
Characterish, or White Wolf, and his son.</p>

<p>The following sarcastic remark was made by the son of
Bel Oiseau, a chief of the first standing among the Grand
Osages while living, who unfortunately was killed by the
Sacs on his way to Washington with the first deputation.
The son of White Hairs, with Shenga Wassa, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">552</a></span>
Beautiful Bird [Bel Oiseau], was to accompany us to the
Pawnee village; but the former proved recreant, and at the
crossing of Grand [Neosho] river said he would return home.
"Shame on you!" said the latter; "what a pity it is so
great and honorable a medal should be disgraced by so
mean a heart!"</p>

<p>You will pardon this digression, but I would wish to convince
you, from what I have seen of Indians, how very
requisite it is to use the utmost caution in the distribution
of our presents and marks of distinction.</p>

<p>Before I set out to visit Tuttasuggy, the ice had commenced
drifting in large sheets, and on my return I found
it running from shore to shore. However, I pushed off and
drifted with it.</p>

<p>The night of the 2d of December was intensely cold, but
hunger obliged me to proceed, and we fortunately reached
the mouth of the Neskalonska [Salt fork of the Arkansaw<a name="FNanchor_V-10" id="FNanchor_V-10" href="#Footnote_V-10" class="fnanchor">[V-10]</a>]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">553</a></span>
river without accident or injury, excepting that one of my
men got frosted. This day we passed two salines which
enter on the southwestern side.</p>

<p>The severity of the weather increased, and the river froze
over on the morning of the 3d. This circumstance placed
me in a situation truly distressing, as my men were almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">554</a></span>
naked; the tatters which covered them were comfortless,
and my ammunition was nearly exhausted. The men
solicited me to hut, but I was resolved by perseverance and
exertion to overcome, if in my power, the obstacles opposed
to my progress.</p>

<p>The Neskalonska is about 120 yards wide, shoal and narrow
at its mouth, but deepens and spreads after you turn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">555</a></span>
the first point. On this stream the Grand and Little Osages
form their temporary fall hunting-camps, and take their
peltries. When the severity of winter sets in, the Grand
Osages retire to Grosse Isle, on the Verdigrise or Wasetihoge;<a name="FNanchor_V-11" id="FNanchor_V-11" href="#Footnote_V-11" class="fnanchor">[V-11]</a>
and the Little Osages to one of its small branches
called Possitonga, where they remain during the hard
weather, and thence return to their towns on the Neska or
[Little] Osage river.</p>

<p>On the 6th the ice began to drift, and I immediately
pushed off with it; but as my evil stars would have it, my
boats again grounded. Being in the middle of the river,
my only alternative was to get out and drag them along for
several miles, when we halted to warm our benumbed feet
and hands. The next day several large cakes of ice had
blocked up the river, and we had to cut our way through
them with axes; the boats as usual grounded, and the men,
bare-legged and bare-footed, were obliged to leap into the
water. This happened so frequently that two more of
them got badly frosted.</p>

<p>On the 8th one of my canoes was driven on a bank of ice
during a snow-storm, and did not overtake me until the
evening of the 9th, in so shattered a condition that she could
hardly be kept above water, and the poor fellows who were
in her were almost frozen.</p>

<p>On the 10th, about noon, I passed the Grand Saline or
Newsewketonga [Cimarron river<a name="FNanchor_V-12" id="FNanchor_V-12" href="#Footnote_V-12" class="fnanchor">[V-12]</a>], which is of a reddish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">556</a></span>
color, though its water is very clear. About two days'
march up this river, you find the prairie grass on the S. W.
side incrusted with salt, and on the N. E. bank, fresh-water
springs, and lakes abounding with fish. This salt the
Arkansaw Osages obtain by scraping it off the prairie with
a turkey's wing into a wooden trencher. The river does
not derive its name from its saline properties, but from the
quantities that may always be found on its banks, and is at
all seasons of the year potable.</p>

<p>On the 20th, in the afternoon, we passed another Saline
[river<a name="FNanchor_V-13" id="FNanchor_V-13" href="#Footnote_V-13" class="fnanchor">[V-13]</a>] with water equally as red as that of the Newsewketonga,
and more strongly impregnated with salt.</p>

<p>After encountering every hardship to which a voyage is
subject in small canoes at so inclement a season of the year,
I arrived on the 23d inst., in a storm of hail and snow, at
the wintering-camp of Cashesegra or Big Track, [or Big
Foot] chief of the Osages who reside on Verdigrise river.</p>

<p>On the following day I gave him your talk and received
his reply, which it is unnecessary to recount fully, as it was
merely a description of his poverty and miserable situation.
He however said that he had been informed the United
States intended to erect factories on the Osage river, and
that he was anxious to have one near to his own village;
and for that purpose he was willing to give the United
States the tract of country lying between the Verdigrise
and Grand [Neosho] rivers. A factory, with a garrison of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">557</a></span>
troops stationed there, would answer the double purpose of
keeping in order those Indians, who are the most desperate
and profligate part of the whole nation, more fully impressing
them with an idea of our consequence, and gaining
more firmly their friendship. It also would tend to preserve
harmony among the Chactaws, Creeks, Cherokees, and
Osages of the three different villages, who are in a constant
state of warfare; further, it would prevent the Osages making
excursions into the country of the poor and peaceably
disposed Caddoes, and might have some effect in confining
the Spaniards to their own territorial limits.</p>

<p>On the 27th I passed the mouths of the Verdigrise and
Grand [Neosho<a name="FNanchor_V-14" id="FNanchor_V-14" href="#Footnote_V-14" class="fnanchor">[V-14]</a>] rivers, the former being about 100 and
the latter 130 yards wide; those streams enter within a
quarter of a mile of each other. Below the mouth of Grand
river commence the rapids, which continue for several
hundred miles down the Arkansaw.</p>

<p>About 58 or 60 miles up the Verdigrise is situate the
Osage village.<a name="FNanchor_V-15" id="FNanchor_V-15" href="#Footnote_V-15" class="fnanchor">[V-15]</a> This band, some four or five years since,
were led by the chief Cashesegra [Big Foot] to the waters
of the Arkansaw, at the request of Pierre Chouteau, for the
purpose of securing their trade, the exclusive trade of the
Osage river having at that time been purchased from the
Spanish governor by Manuel Lisa of St. Louis. But though
Cashesegra be the nominal leader, Clermont, or the Builder
of Towns, is the greatest warrior and most influential man,
now more firmly attached to the interests of the Americans
than any other chief of the nation. He is the lawful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">558</a></span>
sovereign of the Grand Osages; but his hereditary right
was usurped by Pahuska or White Hair [Cheveux Blancs],
while Clermont was yet an infant. White Hair, in fact, is
a chief of Chouteau's creating, as well as Cashesegra; and
neither has the power or disposition to restrain their young
men from the perpetration of an improper act, fearing lest
they should render themselves unpopular.</p>

<p>On the 29th I passed a fall [Webber's] of near seven feet
perpendicular. At evening I was visited by a scout from an
Osage war party, and received from them a man by the name
of M'Farlane, who had been trapping up the Pottoe [Poteau].
We passed about noon this day the mouths of the river des
Illinois,<a name="FNanchor_V-16" id="FNanchor_V-16" href="#Footnote_V-16" class="fnanchor">[V-16]</a> which enters on the N. E. side, and of the Canadian<a name="FNanchor_V-17" id="FNanchor_V-17" href="#Footnote_V-17" class="fnanchor">[V-17]</a>
river, which puts in from the S. W. The latter river
is the main branch of the Arkansaw, and is equally large.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">559</a></span></p>

<p>On the 31st I passed the mouth of the Pottoe,<a name="FNanchor_V-18" id="FNanchor_V-18" href="#Footnote_V-18" class="fnanchor">[V-18]</a> a deep
though narrow stream which puts in on the S. W., and also
the river au Millieu [Milieu<a name="FNanchor_V-19" id="FNanchor_V-19" href="#Footnote_V-19" class="fnanchor">[V-19]</a>], that enters from the N. E.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 6th of January I reached the plantation
of a Mr. Labomme, and was more inhospitably treated
than by the savages themselves.</p>

<p>On the 8th I passed the two upper Arkansaw or Quapaw<a name="FNanchor_V-20" id="FNanchor_V-20" href="#Footnote_V-20" class="fnanchor">[V-20]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">560</a></span>
villages, and on the 9th, after passing the lower Quapaw
town, and a settlement of Chactaws, arrived at the post of
Arkansaw.<a name="FNanchor_V-21" id="FNanchor_V-21" href="#Footnote_V-21" class="fnanchor">[V-21]</a></p>

<p>The surface of the country between the Osage towns and
the Pawnee village is generally broken and naked; the soil
sterile, and abounding with flint and lime stones. As you
approach the waters of the Kanses, it becomes hilly and
sandy. The same may be said of the country between the
Pawnee village and the Arkansaw; but after passing the
ridge which separates the waters of the Kanses and Arkansaw,
the surface becomes more regular and less stony.</p>

<p>Below the Verdigrise the shores of the Arkansaw are generally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">561</a></span>
lined with cane [<i>Arundinaria macrosperma</i>], and
consequently rich bottoms. I was informed by the Indians
that the country to the northwest of the Osage village
abounds with valuable lead mines, but I could make no discovery
of any body of mineral.</p>

<p>The survey from the Arkansaw post to the Mississippi I
fear is not correct, as I was so ill when I descended that
part of the river as to be confined to my blanket.</p>

<p>The chart which accompanies this report, of the course of
the Arkansaw, I hope will prove satisfactory, not only to
yourself, but the president.</p>

<h3><i>Art.  1. Letter, Wilkinson's Instructions to Pike.</i><a name="FNanchor_VI-1" id="FNanchor_VI-1" href="#Footnote_VI-1" class="fnanchor">[VI-1]</a></h3>

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">St. Louis</span>, June 24th, 1806.</p>

<p>SIR: You are to proceed without delay to the cantonment
on the Missouri [at Belle Fontaine], where you
are to embark the late Osage captives and the deputation
recently returned from Washington, with their presents and
baggage, and are to transport the whole up the Missouri
and Osage rivers to the town of the Grand Osage.</p>

<p>The safe delivery of this charge at the point of destination
constitutes the primary object of your expedition;
therefore you are to move with such caution as may prevent
surprise from any hostile band, and are to repel with your
utmost force any outrage which may be attempted.</p>

<p>Having safely deposited your passengers and their property,
you are to turn your attention to the accomplishment
of a permanent peace between the Kanses and Osage nations;
for which purpose you must effect a meeting between
the head chiefs of those nations, and are to employ such
arguments, deduced from their own obvious interests, as
well as the inclinations, desires, and commands of the president
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">563</a></span>
of the United States, as may facilitate your purpose
and accomplish the end.</p>

<p>A third object of considerable magnitude will then claim
your consideration. It is to effect an interview and establish
a good understanding with the Yanctons, Tetaus, or
Camanches.</p>

<p>For this purpose you must interest White Hair, of the
Grand Osage, with whom and a suitable deputation you will
visit the Panis republic, where you may find interpreters,
and inform yourself of the most feasible plan by which to
bring the Camanches to a conference. Should you succeed
in this attempt&mdash;and no pains must be spared to effect it&mdash;you
will endeavor to make peace between that distant powerful
nation and the nations which inhabit the country
between us and them, particularly the Osage; finally, you
will endeavor to induce eight or ten of their distinguished
chiefs to make a visit to the seat of government next September,
and you may attach to this deputation four or five
Panis and the same number of Kanses chiefs.</p>

<p>As your interview with the Camanches will probably lead
you to the head branches of the Arkansaw and Red rivers,
you may find yourself approximated to the settlements of
New Mexico. There it will be necessary you should move
with great circumspection, to keep clear of any hunting or
reconnoitering parties from that province, and to prevent
alarm or offense; because the affairs of Spain and the United
States appear to be on the point of amicable adjustment,
and moreover it is the desire of the president to cultivate the
friendship and harmonious intercourse of all the nations of
the earth, particularly our near neighbors the Spaniards.<a name="FNanchor_VI-2" id="FNanchor_VI-2" href="#Footnote_VI-2" class="fnanchor">[VI-2]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">564</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of your tour, you are to remark particularly
upon the geographical structure, the natural history, and
population of the country through which you may pass, taking
particular care to collect and preserve specimens of everything
curious in the mineral or botanical worlds, which can
be preserved and are portable. Let your courses be regulated
by your compass, and your distances by your watch,
to be noted in a field-book; and I would advise you, when
circumstances permit, to protract and lay down in a separate
book the march of the day at every evening's halt.</p>

<p>The instruments which I have furnished you will enable
you to ascertain the variation of the magnetic needle and
the latitude with exactitude; and at every remarkable point
I wish you to employ your telescope in observing the
eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, having previously regulated
and adjusted your watch by your quadrant, taking care to
note with great nicety the periods of immersions and emersions
of the eclipsed satellites. These observations may
enable us, after your return, by application to the appropriate
tables, which I cannot now furnish you, to ascertain the
longitude.</p>

<p>It is an object of much interest with the executive to
ascertain the direction, extent, and navigation of the Arkansaw
and Red rivers; as far, therefore, as may be compatible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">565</a></span>
with these instructions and practicable to the means you
may command, I wish you to carry your views to those subjects;
and should circumstances conspire to favor the enterprise,
that you may detach a party with a few Osage to
descend the Arkansaw under the orders of Lieutenant Wilkinson,
or Sergeant Ballinger, properly instructed and
equipped to take the courses and distances, to remark on the
soil, timber, etc., and to note the tributary streams. This
party will, after reaching our post on the Arkansaw, descend
to Fort Adams and there await further orders; and you yourself
may descend the Red river, accompanied by a party of
the most respectable Camanches, to the post of Nachitoches,
and there receive further orders.</p>

<p>To disburse your necessary expenses and to aid your
negotiations, you are herewith furnished six hundred dollars'
worth of goods, for the appropriation of which you are
to render a strict account, vouched by documents to be attested
by one of your party.</p>

<p>Wishing you a safe and successful expedition,</p>
<p class="left45">I am, Sir,<br />

<span class="i2">July 12th, 1806.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>The health of the Osages being now generally restored,
and all hopes of the speedy recovery of their prisoners from
the hands of the Potowatomies being at an end, they have
become desirous to commence their journey for their villages;
you are therefore to proceed to-morrow.</p>

<p>In addition to the instructions given you on the 24th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">566</a></span>
ultimo, I must request you to have the talks under cover
delivered to White Hair and Grand Peste, the chief of the
Osage band which is settled on the waters of the Arkansaw,
together with the belts which accompany them. You will
also receive herewith a small belt for the Panis and a large
one for the Tetaus or Camanches.</p>

<p>Should you find it necessary, you are to give orders to
Maugraine, the resident interpreter at the Grand Osage, to
attend you.</p>

<p>I beg you to take measures for the security and safe
return of your boats from the Grand Osage to this place.</p>

<p>Dr. Robinson will accompany you as a volunteer. He will
be furnished medicines, and for the accommodations which
you give him he is bound to attend your sick.</p>

<p>Should you discover any unlicensed traders in your route,
or any person from this territory, or from the United States,
without a proper license or passport, you are to arrest such
person or persons and dispose of their property as the law
directs.</p>

<p>My confidence in your caution and discretion has prevented
my urging you to be vigilant in guarding against the
strategy and treachery of the Indians; holding yourself
above alarm or surprise, the composition of your party,
though it be small, will secure to you the respect of a host
of untutored savages.</p>

<p>You are to communicate, from the Grand Osage and from
every other practicable point, directly to the secretary of
war, transmitting your letters to this place under cover, to
the commanding officer, or by any more convenient route.</p>

<p>I wish you health and a successful and honorable enterprise,

<span class="smcap">St. Charles</span>, July 17th, 1806.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>We arrived here last evening all well, except some of the
soldiers from fatigue, as in the present state of the water we
are obliged to row altogether.</p>

<p>We were disappointed in obtaining any information from
St. Louis, or baggage for our Panis. I do not know how it
will be digested by them. We likewise were disappointed
in receiving a line from you, as we had here expected, and
in the hopes of which I shall yet detain until twelve o'clock
and then take my departure. Our Osage conduct themselves
pretty well, and are very obedient to orders; at first
they had an idea a little too free relative to other people's
property, but at present stand corrected.</p>

<p>I understood from you that they were equipped by Mr.
Tillier with everything necessary for their voyage to their
towns; consequently, although they have been applying to
me for a variety of articles, none of which have they been
gratified with, but powder and ball, which is necessary for
their own defense.</p>

<p>The general will pardon this scrawl; and should he send
an express after us, please to let Mrs. Pike know of the
opportunity.</p>

<p class="left45">I am, dear Sir,<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Dear General</span>:</p>

<p>Inclosed you have one of the articles subscribed by Mr.
[George] Henry, mentioned in my note of yesterday.<a name="FNanchor_VI-4" id="FNanchor_VI-4" href="#Footnote_VI-4" class="fnanchor">[VI-4]</a> I
hope the general may approve of the contents.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Wilkinson and Dr. Robinson marched with
one soldier this morning, and the boats have proceeded
under the conduct of [Sergeant] Ballenger; I shall overtake
them in an hour or two.</p>

<p>Numerous reports have been made to the Indians [we
have with us], calculated to impress them with an idea that
there is a small army of their enemies waiting to receive us
at the entrance of the Grand Osage. But I have partly
succeeded in scouting the idea from their minds.</p>

<p>No news of Chouteau, nor Panis' trunks.</p>

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">Village De Charette</span>, July 22d, 1806.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear General</span>:</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your two
obliging favors of the 18th and 19th inst. The particular
contents of each shall be punctually attended to.</p>

<p>I assure you, Sir, that I am extremely pleased with the
idea that Messrs. [Blank] and [Blank] will meet with their
merited reward, and I on my part am determined to show
them that it is not their sinister movements that can derange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">569</a></span>
the objects of our voyage; the greatest embarrassment
they have yet occasioned me has been by the
detention of the Panis' baggage, who have been much
mortified on the occasion. But I question much if, under
similar impressions and circumstances, many white men
would have borne their loss with more philosophy than our
young savages.</p>

<p>I conceive that I cannot dispose of one of my guns
better than to give it to Frank, whose fusee was left at
Chouteau's; also, each of them a soldier's coat; this is all
the remuneration I will pretend to make them, and I hope
it may bring them to a good humor.</p>

<p>You will probably be surprised at the slow progress we
have made, but are already informed of the cause of our
detention at St. Charles. Since then we have been detained
two days on account of the rain; and although we were
able to prevent the water from entering immediately on the
top of the boat where covered, yet the quantity which she
made at both ends occasioned so much dampness under the
loading as to injure both my own corn and that of the
Indians, with other small articles which they had at various
times taken from under the loading and not returned to
their proper places; but they appear satisfied that we
have paid all possible attention to prevent injury to their
baggage&mdash;as much as, and indeed more than, to our own.</p>

<p>In consequence of the above, and with a design to write
you, I halted here to-day, which I hope we shall usefully employ
in drying our baggage, cleaning our arms, and putting
ourselves in a posture of defense. Lieutenant Wilkinson
has experienced no inconvenience from his march by land
with the Indians; and the event has proved the necessity
of some officer accompanying them, as he informs me. He
found it necessary to purchase some beeves for their consumption
on the route, for which he drew on the superintendent
of Indian affairs, and will write to you more
particularly on the subject. They were absent from the
boat four days; and had he not been with them, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">570</a></span>
would have supplied themselves by marauding, to the great
offense of our good citizens.</p>

<p>I am informed that a party of 40 Sacs were at Boon's
Lick, above the Osage river, a few days since; but I by no
means conceive they were on the route to intercept us, as
the people pretend at this place.</p>

<p>Three days since one of my men [Kennerman] complained
of indisposition, and went on shore to march; he
has never joined the party, and from various reasons I conceive
has deserted. I have therefore inclosed an advertisement
which, if the general will please to cause to be
posted at St. Louis, Kaskaskias, and Lusk's Ferry on the
Ohio, I conceive he will be caught. I have written to
Captain Daniel Bissell<a name="FNanchor_VI-5" id="FNanchor_VI-5" href="#Footnote_VI-5" class="fnanchor">[VI-5]</a> on the occasion; but hope the
general will enforce my request to that gentleman, as to his
[Kennerman's] being brought to trial. I was much mortified
at the event, not only on account of the loss of the
man, but that my peculiar situation prevented me from
pursuing him and making him an example.</p>

<p>With respect to the Tetaus, the general may rest assured,
I shall use every precaution previous to trusting them; but
as to the mode of conduct to be pursued towards the Spaniards,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">571</a></span>
I feel more at a loss, as my instructions lead me into
the country of the Tetaus, part of which is no doubt claimed
by Spain, although the boundaries between Louisiana and
New Mexico, have never yet been defined, in consequence
of which, should I encounter a party from the villages near
Santa Fe, I have thought it would be good policy to give
them to understand, that we were about to join our troops
near Natchitoches, but had been uncertain about the head
waters of the rivers over which we passed; but, that now, if
the commandant approved of it, we would pay him a visit of
politeness, either by deputation, or the whole party, but if
he refused, signify our intention of pursuing our direct route
to the post below; but if not I flatter myself secure us an
unmolested retreat to Natchitoches. But if the Spanish
jealousy, and the instigation of domestic traitors should
induce them to make us prisoners of war, (in time of peace)
I trust to the magnanimity of our country for our liberation
and a due reward to their opposers, for the insult and
indignity offered their national honor. However, unless they
give us ample assurances of just and honorable treatment,
according to the custom of nations in like cases, I would
resist, even if the inequality was as great as at the affair of
Bender [town in Russia], or the streights of Thermopylæ.<a name="FNanchor_VI-6" id="FNanchor_VI-6" href="#Footnote_VI-6" class="fnanchor">[VI-6]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">572</a></span></p>

<p>Will you pardon the foregoing as the enthusiasm of a
youthful mind, yet not altogether unimpressed by the dictates
of prudence?</p>

<p>I hope the general will be persuaded that with his son I
shall act as I would to a brother, endeavoring in all cases
to promote his honor and prosperity.</p>

<p>In consequence of indisposition, etc., Lieut. Wilkinson
will steer one boat and I the other.</p>

<span class="smcap">Village de Charette</span>, Evening of July 22d, 1806.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>Finding no prospect of meeting with a private conveyance
of our letters in time sufficient to find you previous to our
setting sail, which would be entirely too late to secure my
deserter and give you the other information they contain,
I have hired the bearer to ride express to Belle Fontaine,
for which I have promised him $8; which, taking into view

all safe, although our savages complain much of fatigue, etc.</p>

<p>The bearer had been sent by Mr. Sangonet [Charles Sanguinet,

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">Cantonment Missouri</span> [at Belle Fontaine],<br />

<span class="i2">Aug. 6th, 1806.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>In consequence of the receipt of the inclosed letters,
I have thought proper to send you an express, to enable
you to announce to the Osage the designs of their enemies,
that they may take seasonable measures to circumvent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">574</a></span>
them. You will not fail, in addition to the within talk,
to enhance our paternal regard for this nation by every
proper expression; but are to keep clear of any conflict in
which they may be involved, though you are to avoid the
appearance of abandoning them. If it should be the Potowatomies'
intention to carry their threat into execution, it
is probable they will not attempt to make the blow before
the falling of the leaves; and in the mean time the Osages
should establish a chain of light scouts along the coast of
the Missouri, to ascertain with certainty the approach of
their enemy.</p>

<p>It is reduced to a certainty that [Manuel de Lisa] and
a society of which he is the ostensible leader have determined
on a project to open some commercial intercourse
with Santa Fe; and as this may lead to a connection
injurious to the United States, and will, I understand, be
attempted without the sanction of law or the permission of
the executive, you must do what you can consistently to
defeat the plan. No good can be derived to the United
States from such a project, because the prosecution of it
will depend entirely on the Spaniards, and they will not
permit it, unless to serve their political as well as their personal
interests. I am informed that the ensuing autumn
and winter will be employed in reconnoitering and opening
a connection with the Tetaus, Panis, etc.; that this fall or
the next winter, a grand magazine is to be established at
the Osage towns, where these operations will commence;
that [Lisa] is to be the active agent, having formed a connection
with the Tetaus. This will carry forward their
merchandise within three or four days' travel of the Spanish
settlements, where they will deposit it under a guard of 300
Tetaus. [Lisa] will then go forward with four or five
attendants, taking with him some jewelry and fine goods.
With those he will visit the governor, to whom he will
make presents, and implore his pity by a fine tale of sufferings
which have been endured by the change of government;
that they are left here, with goods to be sure, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">575</a></span>
not a dollar's worth of bullion, and therefore they have
adventured to see him, for the purpose of praying his leave
for the introduction of their property into the province. If
he assents, then the whole of the goods will be carried forward;
if he refuses, then [Lisa] will invite some of his
countrymen to accompany him to his deposit, and having
there exposed to them his merchandise, he will endeavor to
open a forced or clandestine trade; for he observes, the
Spaniards will not dare to attack his camp. Here you have
the plan, and you must take all prudent and lawful means
to blow it up.</p>

<p>In regard to your approximation to the Spanish settlements,
should your route lead you near them, or should you
fall in with any of their parties, your conduct must be
marked by such circumspection and discretion as may prevent
alarm or conflict, as you will be held responsible for
consequences. On this subject I refer you to my orders.
We have nothing new respecting the pending negotiations
in Europe; but from Colonel [T. H.] Cushing I understand
the Spaniards below are behaving now with great courtesy.</p>

<p>By the return of the bearer you may open your correspondence
with the secretary of war [General Dearborn];
but I would caution you against anticipating a step before
you, for fear of deception and disappointment. To me you
may, and must, write fully and freely, not only giving
a minute detail of everything past worthy of note, but also
of your prospects and the conduct of the Indians. If you
discover that any tricks have been played from St. Louis,
you will give them to me with names, and must not fail to
give particulars to the secretary of war, with names, to warn
him against improper confidence and deception. Inclose
your dispatch for me to Colonel [T.] Hunt, and it will follow
me by a party which I leave for the purpose. It is interesting
to you to reach Nachitoches in season to be at the seat
of government pending the session of Congress; yet you
must not sacrifice any essential object to this point. Should
fortune favor you on your present excursion, your importance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">576</a></span>
to our country will, I think, make your future life
comfortable.</p>

<p>To show you how to correct your watch by the quadrant,
after it has been carefully adjusted, preparatory to your
observing the eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter, I send
you a very simple plan, which you will readily understand:
a basin of water, in some place protected from the motion
of the air, will give you a fairer artificial horizon than mercury.
I think a tent, with a suitable aperture in the side
of it, would do very well. I have generally unroofed a
cabin.</p>

<p>Miranda has botched his business. He has lost his two
schooners captured, and himself in the Leander returned to
Jamaica. The French have a squadron of four frigates at
Porto Rico, and five sail of the line with Jerome Bonaparte
at Martinique. I consider them lost.</p>

<p>Your children have been indisposed; but Mrs. Pike writes
you. She appears well. My regards to your associates,
and may God protect you.</p>

<span class="smcap">Park on the Osage River</span>, Aug. 14th, 1806.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>I send this letter by Baptiste la Tulip [<a href="#Footnote_I-36">note<sup>36</sup>, p. 381</a>],
who informs me he bears letters to Chouteau, informing
him that a party of Little Osages have marched to war
against the Kanses, and a party of Grand Osages left the
village expressly to make war on the white people on the
Arkansaw. This latter step White Hair did everything in
his power to prevent, but could not. If true, what are we
to think of our <i>bons amis</i>, the Osage?</p>

<p>But to [Manuel de Lisa] must we ascribe the stroke
against the Kanses. He I am informed sent a message to
the Osage nation to raze the Kanses village entirely. On
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">577</a></span>
this subject I intended to have been more particular, and
substantiate it by proofs; but present circumstances seem
to give credit to it. On my arrival at the village, more particular
inquiry shall be made on the subject.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning Lieutenant Wilkinson, the doctor,
interpreter, and one soldier, marched with the Indians, as
they were very apprehensive of an attack. The people in
the canoe heard them crying and saw them on their march.</p>

<p>Nothing extraordinary has yet taken place on our route,
except our being favored with a vast quantity of rain, which
I hope will enable us to ascend to the village.</p>

<p>What face will the Indians receive us with? And to
whom are we to ascribe their hostile disposition, unless to
the traitors of St. Louis?</p>

<p>Lieutenant Wilkinson is in very good health, and will
lament his having missed this opportunity of assuring his
parents of his love and affection.</p>

Blanche, and on the 21st held a grand council of both
towns, and made the necessary communications and demands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">578</a></span>
for horses, on the subjects of making peace with the
Kans, accompanying me to the Panis, [and Wilkinson] down
the Arkansaw, and [to ascertain] if there were any brave
enough to accompany me the whole voyage.</p>

<p>They requested one day to hold council in the villages,
previous to giving an answer. It was three before I
received any; their determination was as follows: From
the Grand Osage village, or [that of] Cheveux Blanche, we
are accompanied by his son, and Jean La Fon [Le Fou],
the second chief of the village, with some young men not
known, and he furnishes us four horses.</p>

<p>The Little Osage sends the brother of the chief, whom
I really find to be the third chief of the village, and some
young men unknown, and furnishes six horses. This is
their present promise, but four of the ten are yet deficient.
With these I am merely capable of transporting our merchandise
and ammunition. I shall purchase two more, for
which I find we shall be obliged to pay extravagant prices.</p>

<p>I sincerely believe that the two chiefs, White Hair and
Wind, have exerted all their influence; but it must be little,
when they could only procure 10 horses out of 700 or 800.</p>

<p>I have taken an exact survey of the river to this place,
noting particular streams, etc., a protracted copy of which
Lieutenant Wilkinson forwards by this opportunity. Since
our arrival here I have ascertained the variation of the
compass to be 6° 30´ E.; the latitude, by means of several
observations, 37° 26´ 17´´ N.; and by an observation on three
different nights I obtained two immersions of Jupiter's satellites,
which will enable us to ascertain every geographical
object in view.</p>

<p>On the same night I arrived near the village, Mr. Baptist
Duchouquette, alias Larme, with two men, in a small canoe,
arrived and went immediately to the lodge of White Hair,
whose conduct, with that of our resident interpreter, appears
in my estimation to have changed since I sent Lieutenant
Wilkinson to demand to see Baptist's passport, if he had
one, and if not, to bring him to camp; which was done. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">579</a></span>
detained him two days, until I had made an inquiry of White
Hair, who said he had merely mentioned to him that
Labardie was coming with a quantity of goods. Finding I
could substantiate nothing more criminal against him than
his having entered the Indian boundaries without a passport,
and not being able to send him back a prisoner, I
detained him a sufficient time to alarm him, then took his
deposition (a copy of which is inclosed to the attorney-general),
and wrote Dr. Brown on the occasion, requesting
him to enter a prosecution against these men [see <a href="#Footnote_I-44">note<sup>44</sup>,
p. 388</a>, Aug. 20th, 1806].</p>

<p>Barroney informs me that he has not the least doubt that
[Lisa] was at the bottom of this embassy, although in the
name of [Labardie]; as after the arrival of Baptist, the
Indians frequently spoke of [Lisa] and declared that if he
had come he could have obtained horses in plenty.</p>

<p>Our interpreter, Maugraine, also, I do believe to be a
perfect creature of [Lisa]; he has almost positively refused
to accompany me, although I read your order on the subject,
alleging he was only engaged to interpret at this place,
notwithstanding he went last year to the Arkansaw for Mr.
Chouteau without difficulty. I have not yet determined on
the line of conduct to be pursued with him; but believe, on
his giving a positive refusal, I shall use military law. What
the result will be is uncertain; but to be thus braved by a
scoundrel will be lessening the dignity of our government.
He is married into a powerful family, and appears, next to
White Hair, to have the most influence in the Grand
[Osage] village. The general will please to observe that
much of the foregoing rests on conjecture, and therefore
will give it its due weight. But to him I not only write as
my general, but as a paternal friend, who would not make
use of my open communications, when not capable of being
substantiated by proofs.</p>

<p>We have heard nothing of the Potowatomies; but should
they come in a few days, they will meet with a warm reception,
as all are ready to receive them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">580</a></span></p>

<p>Since my arrival here many Spanish medals have been
shown me, and some commissions. All I have done on
the subject is merely to advise their delivery below, when
they would be acknowledged by our government. Many
have applied for permission to go to Saint Louis; none of
which I have granted except to the son of Sans Orielle,
who goes down to make inquiry for his sister.</p>

<p>I have advanced our express some things on account, and
forward his receipts; also, some trifles to Barroney, whom I
have found to be one of the finest young men I ever knew
in his situation. He appears to have entirely renounced all
his Saint Louis connections, and is as firm an American as
if born one; he of course is entirely discarded by the people
of Saint Louis; but I hope he will not suffer for his fidelity.</p>

<p>On the chart forwarded by Lieutenant Wilkinson is noted
the census which I caused to be taken of the village of the
Little Osage; that of the big one I shall likewise obtain&mdash;they
are from actual enumeration. Lieutenant Wilkinson,
if nothing extraordinary prevents, will descend the Arkansaw,
accompanied by Ballenger and two men, as the former
is now perfectly acquainted with the mode of taking courses
and protracting his route, and the latter appears as if he
had not the proper capacity for it, although a good dispositioned
and brave man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>I will continue my communications by relating that Wind
has come in and informed me that the other two horses
which he promised have been withdrawn by their owners.
He appeared really distressed, and I conceive I do him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">581</a></span>
justice in believing that he is extremely mortified at the
deceptions which have been passed on him.</p>

<p>It is with extreme pain that I keep myself cool amongst
the difficulties which those people appear to have a disposition
to throw in my way; but I have declared to them
that I should go on, even if I collected our tents and other
baggage which we will be obliged to leave together, and
burnt them on the spot.</p>

<p>I have sold the batteau which I brought up, and which
was extremely rotten, for $100 in merchandise, the price at
this place; which I conceive was preferable to leaving her
to destruction, as I am afraid I do the barge (for which I
demanded $150), although I leave her under the charge of
Wind, and shall report her to Colonel [Thomas] Hunt.</p>

<p>I shall dispatch the express to-morrow, as he complains
much of the detention, etc., and as I hope nothing worthy
of note will occur at this place previous to our departure.
I hope the general will believe me to be and, should this be
my last report, to have been, his sincerely attached friend

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">Osage Towns</span>, Aug. 30th, 1806.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>I have brought Mr. Noal, alias Maugraine, to reason, and
he either goes himself or hires, at his expense, a young man
who is here who speaks the Panis language, and in many
other respects is preferable to himself; but he will be the
bearer of the express to Saint Louis.</p>

<p>Cheveux Blanche requested me to inform you that there
is an Osage murderer in his village, who killed a Frenchman
on the Arkansaw; but owing to the great dissensions
and schism of the Arkansaw faction, he is fearful to deliver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">582</a></span>
him up without some of his friends having agreed to it,
and his authority being strengthened by a formal demand
from you; when he assures me he shall be brought down
a prisoner. Indeed Cheveux Blanche appears to be very
delicately situated, as the village on the Arkansaw serves
as a place of refuge for all the young, daring, and discontented;
added to which, they are much more regularly
supplied with ammunition, and, should not our government
take some steps to prevent it, they will ruin the Grand
village, as they are at liberty to make war without restraint,
especially on the nations who are to the west, and have
plenty of horses. The chief says he was promised, at
Washington, that these people should be brought back to
join him; but, on the contrary, many of his village are emigrating
there.</p>

<p>Owing to the difficulty of obtaining horses, Mr. Henry
returns from this place. In descending the Mississippi I
will request him to pay his respects to you.</p>

<p>I last evening took the census of the Grand village, and
found it to be: men, 502; boys, 341; women and girls,
852; total, 1695; lodges, 214.</p>

<p>The express waits, which I hope the general will accept
as an excuse for this scrawl, having written him fully on the
28th and 29th inst.</p>

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">Pawnee Republic</span>, Oct. 1st, 1806.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>We arrived here on the 25th ult., after a tedious march of
375 miles, the distance, as I conceive, being very much augmented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">583</a></span>
by the Osages who accompanied us leading us too
far to the south, owing to their great fear of the Kans. We
suffered considerably with thirst, but our guns furnished us
amply with buffalo meat.</p>

<p>We delivered in safety to the chief the two young Pawnees
who had lately visited Washington, and caused to be
explained to the nation the parole which they bore from the
president of the United States.</p>

<p>On our arrival, we found the Spanish and American flags
both expanded in the village, and were much surprised to
learn that it was not more than three or four weeks since
a party of Spanish troops, whose numbers were estimated
by the Indians of this town at 300, had returned to
Santa Fe. We further learned that a large body of troops
had left N. Mexico, and on their march had met with the
villagers of the Pawnee Mahaws, who were on one of their
semi-annual excursions; that they encamped together, and
entered into a treaty; but after this the Pawnees raised their
camp in the night, and stole a large portion of the Spaniards'
horses. This circumstance induced them to halt on
the Arkansaw with the main body of the troops, and to send
forward the party who appeared at this village. They proposed
to this chief to join a party of his warriors to their
troops, march to and entirely destroy the village of the Pawnee
Mahaws; this proposition he had prudence enough to
reject, although at war with that nation. The Spanish
officer informed him that his superior, who remained on the
Arkansaw, had marched from Santa Fe with an intention of
entering into a treaty with the following nations of Indians,
viz.: The Kanses, Pawnee Republic, Grand Pawnees, Pawnee
Loups, Otos, and Mahaws; and had with him a grand
medal, commissions, and four mules for each; but by the
stroke of the Pawnee Mahaws the plan was disconcerted,
except only as to this nation. The commissions are dated
Santa Fe, 15th of June, 1806, signed governor-general, etc.,
etc., of New Mexico, and run in the usual style of Spanish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">584</a></span>
commissions to savages, as far as I was capable of judging
of their contents.</p>

<p>The chief further informed me that the officer who commanded
said party was too young to hold councils, etc.;
that he had only come to open the road; that in the
spring his superior would be here, and teach the Indians
what was good for them; and that they would build a
town near them. In short, it appears to me to have been
an expedition expressly for the purpose of striking a dread
into those different nations of the Spanish power, and to
bring about a general combination in its favor. Under
these impressions, I have taken the earliest opportunity of
reporting the infringement of our territory, in order that our
government may not remain in the dark as to the views of
her neighbor.</p>

<p>I effected a meeting at this place between a few Kans
and Osages, who smoked the pipe of peace and buried the
hatchet, agreeably to the wishes of their great father; in
consequence of which a Kans has marched for the Osage
nation, and some of the latter propose to accompany the
former to their village; whether this good understanding
will be permanent, I will not take on me to determine; but
at least a temporary good effect has succeeded.</p>

<p>From the Osage towns, I have taken the courses and distances
by the route we came, marking each river or rivulet
we crossed, pointing out the dividing ridges, etc. The
waters which we crossed were the heads of the [Little]
Osage, White [Neosho], and Verdigrise rivers, [the two last]
branches of the Arkansaw, and the waters of the [Smoky
Hill fork of the] Kans river. The latitude of this place, I
presume, will be in about 39° 30´ N., and I hope to obtain
every other astronomical observation which will be requisite
to fix its geographical situation beyond dispute. I expect
to march from here in a few days; but the future prospects
of the voyage are entirely uncertain, as the savages strive to
throw every impediment in our way, agreeably to the orders
received from the Spaniards. Being seated on the ground,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">585</a></span>
and writing on the back of a book, I hope will plead my
excuse for this scrawl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Hon. Henry Dearborn</span>,<br />

<span class="i2">Secretary War Department.</span></p>

<hr class="l15 p2" />
<h3><i>Art.  14. Letter, Pike to Wilkinson. (<a name="orig14" id="orig14">Orig. No. 14</a>, pp. 47-50.)</i></h3>

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">Pawnee Republic</span>, Oct. 2d, 1806.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear General</span>:</p>

<p>Inclosed you have a copy of my letter from this place to
the secretary of war, in order that, should you think any
communication on the contents necessary, you may have a
perfect command of the information given the war department,
and will be the more capable of illustrating the
subject.</p>

<p>You will perceive by said communication, that we were led
considerably out of our course by our guides, in my opinion
not less than 100 miles; this was entirely owing to the pusillanimity
of the Osage, who were more afraid of the Kans
than I could possibly have imagined.</p>

<p>You will likewise perceive the council which took place
between those nations under our auspices, and its effects, but
which I candidly confess I have very little hopes will be productive
of a permanent peace, as none of the principal men
of either nation were present; but as both are anxious for a
cessation of hostilities, perhaps it may have the desired
effect.</p>

<p>Two of the Kans chiefs have said they will pursue the
voyage with me agreeably to my orders. I do not yet know
whether they will descend the Arkansaw with Lieut. Wilkinson,
or continue on to Red river with me; but they have
their own selection.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">586</a></span></p>

<p>The general will no doubt be struck with some surprise to
perceive that so large a party of Spanish troops have been
so lately in our territory. No doubt at first you would conclude
that it must have been militia; but when informed
that their infantry were armed with muskets and bayonets
and had drums, that the men wore long mustaches and whiskers
which almost covered the whole of their faces; that
their cavalry were armed with swords and pistols, and that
regular guards and patrols were kept by horse and foot, you
may probably change your opinion.</p>

<p>The route by which they came and returned was by no
means the direct one from Santa Fe, and why they should
have struck so low down as the Grand Saline, unless they
had an idea of striking at the village of the Grand Pest, or conceived
the Saline to be in their territory, I cannot imagine.</p>

<p>On our arrival here, we were received with great pomp
and ceremony by about 300 men on horseback, and with
great apparent friendship by the chief. The Osage (one
chief and four warriors) were presented with eight horses;
the Kans who arrived two days after were also presented
with horses. The day after, we assembled the four principal
chiefs to dine, after which I presented the principal with a
double-barreled gun, gorget,<a name="FNanchor_VI-7" id="FNanchor_VI-7" href="#Footnote_VI-7" class="fnanchor">[VI-7]</a> and other articles (this man
wore the grand Spanish medal); gave to the second the
small medal you furnished me, with other articles; and to
each of the others a gorget in their turn. Those presents
I conceived would have a good effect, both as to
attaching them to our government and in our immediate
intercourse.</p>

<p>At the council which was held a day or two afterward
I presented them with merchandise which at this place
should be valued at $250; and after explaining their relative
situation as to the Spanish and American governments,
I asked on my part, if they would assist us with a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">587</a></span>
horses, a Tetau prisoner who spoke Pawnee to serve as an
interpreter, an exchange of colors, and finally, for some of
their chiefs to accompany us, to be sent on to Washington.
The exchange of colors was the only request granted at
the time; and for particular reasons, which Lieut. Wilkinson
related, I thought proper to return them to the chief. After
spending two or three anxious days, we were given to understand
that our requests could not be complied with in the
other points, and were again strongly urged by the head
chief to return the way we came, and not prosecute our
voyage any further. This brought on an explanation as to
our views toward the Spanish government, in which the
chief declared that it had been the intention of the Spanish
troops to proceed further toward the Mississippi, but
that he objected to it, and they listened to him and returned;
he therefore hoped we would be equally reasonable.
Finding me still determined on proceeding, he told me in
plain terms (if the interpreter erred not) that it was the will
of the Spaniards we should not proceed; which I not answering,
he painted innumerable difficulties which he said
lay in the way; but finding all his arguments had no effect,
he said "it was a pity," and was silent.</p>

<p>This day I have sent out several of my party to purchase
horses, but know not yet how we shall succeed, as the Kans
have intimated an idea that the chief will prohibit his
people from trading with us.</p>

<p>The Pawnees and the Tetaus are at war; the latter killed
six of the former in August last; consequently effecting any
communication with the Tetaus by means of this nation is
impossible.</p>

<p>If God permits, we shall march from here in a few days,
and on the Arkansaw I shall remain until I build two small
canoes for Lieut. W[ilkinson], whose party will consist of
Ballenger and two or three men, with three Osage. Those
canoes will be easily managed, and in case of accident to
one, the other will still be sufficient to transport their
baggage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">588</a></span></p>

<p>I am informed that in a few days he will meet French
hunters, and probably arrive at the village of the Grand
Pest in a fortnight; as all the Osage nation are apprised of
his descent, I conceive he will meet with no insurmountable
difficulties.<a name="FNanchor_ON-A" id="FNanchor_ON-A" href="#Footnote_ON-A" class="fnanchor">a</a> The Tetaus are at open war with the
Spaniards, so that could we once obtain an introduction,
I conceive we should meet with a favorable reception. Yet
how it is to be brought about I am much at a loss to determine;
but knowing that, at this crisis of affairs, an intimate
connection with that nation might be extremely serviceable
to my country, I shall proceed to find them, in hopes to
find some means, through the French, Osage, and Pawnee
languages, of making ourselves understood.</p>

<p>Any number of men who may reasonably be calculated
on would find no difficulty in marching by the route we
came, with baggage wagons, field artillery, and all the usual
appendages of a small army; and if all the route to Santa
Fe should be of the same description, in case of war I would
pledge my life and what is infinitely dearer, my honor, for
the successful march of a reasonable body of troops into the
province of New Mexico.</p>

<p>I find the savages of this country less brave, but possessing
much more duplicity and by far a greater propensity to
lying and stealing, than those I had to pass through on my
last [Mississippi] voyage.</p>

<p>I am extremely doubtful if any chief of those nations can
be induced to prosecute the voyage with us, as their dread
of the Tetaus and the objections of the Pawnees seem to
outweigh every argument and inducement to the contrary.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_ON-A" id="Footnote_ON-A" href="#FNanchor_ON-A"><span class="label">a</span></a> This was erroneous, but it was my impression at the time. (Orig. note.)</p>

<p class="left65 p2"><span class="smcap">Oct. 3d.</span></p>

<p>The Pawnee chief has induced the Kans to return to their
villages, by giving them a gun and promising horses, with
many frightful pictures drawn [of what would happen] if
they proceeded.</p>

<p>The Osages lent me five horses, which their people who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">589</a></span>
accompanied us were to have led back; but receiving fresh
ones from the Pawnees, they would not be troubled with
them. In fact, it was a fortunate circumstance, as four of
the horses I obtained of the Osage have such bad backs
they cannot proceed, and we will be obliged to leave them;
and not purchasing here with facility, I would have been
obliged to sacrifice some of our baggage. I therefore sent
them a certificate for each horse, on the Indian agent below,
which I hope the general will order him to discharge.</p>

<p>I know the general's goodness will excuse this scrawl, as
he is well acquainted with the situation it must be written
in, and at the same time, believe me to be his sincere friend
and</p>

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">On the Arkansaw</span>, latitude 37° 44´ 9´´ N., Oct. 24th, 1806.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear General</span>:</p>

<p>Our party arrived here on the 15th inst., myself and Dr.
Robinson on the 19th [18th by Itinerary, <a href="#Page_427">p. 427</a>]. We,
having been out to seek the trace of the Spanish troops,
missed the party, and were not able to join them until the
4th [3d] day.</p>

<p>The river being very regular, Lieut. Wilkinson had calculated
to proceed on the day following on the most direct
route for the Red [<i>sic</i>] river; but shortly after my joining,
considerable rain fell and raised the river, and we have been
ever since preparing wooden and skin canoes for that
gentleman and party to descend in. The river is between
300 and 400 yards in width, with generally flat low banks,
not more than two or three feet high, and the bed a sand-bank
from one side to the other. The want of water will
present the greatest obstacle to the progress of the party
who descend the Arkansaw, as they have no cause to fear
a scarcity of provision, having some bushels of corn on
hand, and can at their option take as much dried meat as
they think proper, hundreds of pounds of which are lying
on scaffolds at our camp; and they are likewise accompanied
by the choice of our hunters.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">592</a></span></p>

<p>Under these circumstances, and those stated in my letter
from the Pawnees, I can assert with confidence there are no
obstacles I should hesitate to encounter, although those
inseparable from a voyage of several hundred leagues
through a wilderness inhabited only by savages may appear
of the greatest magnitude to minds unaccustomed to such
enterprises. Lieut. Wilkinson and party appear in good
spirits, and show a disposition which must vanquish every
difficulty.</p>

<p>We were eight days traveling from the Pawnee village to
the Arkansaw, our general course S. 10° W. Several days
we lay by nearly half, owing to various circumstances; my
course made it 150 miles, but I could now march it in 120.
Lieut. Wilkinson has copied and carries with him a very
elegant protracted sketch of the route, noting the streams,
hills, etc., that we crossed; their courses, bearings, etc.; and
should I live to arrive, I will pledge myself to show their
connections and general direction with considerable accuracy,
as I have myself spared no pains in reconnoitering
or obtaining information from the savages in our route.</p>

<p>From this point we shall ascend the river until we strike
the mountains, or find the Tetaus; thence bear more to the
S. until we find the head of the Red river, where we shall be
detained some time; after which nothing shall cause a halt
until my arrival at Natchitoches.</p>

<p>I speak in all those cases in the positive mood, as, so far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">593</a></span>
as lies in the compass of human exertions, we command the
power; but I pretend not to surmount impossibilities, and
I well know the general will pardon my anticipating a
little to him.</p>

<p>The general will probably be surprised to find that the
expenses<a name="FNanchor_VI-9" id="FNanchor_VI-9" href="#Footnote_VI-9" class="fnanchor">[VI-9]</a> of the expedition will more than double the contemplated
sum of our first calculations; but I conceived
the Spaniards were making such great exertions to debauch
the minds of our savages, economy might be very improperly
applied, and I likewise have found the purchase of
horses to be attended with much greater expense than was
expected at St. Louis. For those reasons, when I advert to
the expenses of my two voyages, which I humbly conceive
might be compared with the one performed by Captains
Lewis and Clark, and the appropriations made for theirs,
I feel a consciousness that it is impossible for the most
rigid to censure my accounts.</p>

<p>I cannot yet say if I shall sacrifice my horses at Red river,
but every exertion shall be made to save them for the
public; some, if in good condition, would be fine ones, and
average between $50 and $60. Should the fortune of war
at length have honored me with a company,<a name="FNanchor_VI-10" id="FNanchor_VI-10" href="#Footnote_VI-10" class="fnanchor">[VI-10]</a> I hope the
general will recollect his promise to me, and have my command
attached to it; and on my arrival I shall take the
liberty of soliciting his influence, that they may obtain the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">594</a></span>
same or similar rewards, as those who accompanied Capt.
Lewis; as I will make bold to say that they have in the two
voyages incurred as great dangers, and gone through as
many hardships.</p>

<p>Dr. Robinson presents his respectful compliments, and is
sanguine of the success of our expedition.</p>

<p class="left45">I am, dear General,<br />

<span class="i2">Your ever attached friend</span><br />

<span class="i4">and obedient servant,</span><br />

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">
ITINERARY: THROUGH NEW MEXICO ON THE RIO GRANDE
TO EL PASO, FEB. 27TH-MAR. 21ST, 1807.
</span></h2>

<p>Friday, Feb. 27th, 1807. In the morning I discovered
that the Spanish lieutenant [Don Ignatio Saltelo] was
writing letters addressed to the governor and others; on
which I demanded if he was not going on with me to Santa
Fe. He appeared confused and said, No; that his orders
were so positive as to the safe conduct and protection of my
men, that he dare not go and leave any behind; that his
companion [Don Bartolomé Fernandez] would accompany
me to Santa Fe with 50 men, while he with the others
would wait for the sergeant [Meek] and his party. I replied
that he had deceived me, and had not acted with candor;
but that it was now too late for me to remedy the evil.</p>

<p>We marched about eleven o'clock, ascending the Rio del
Norte [read Rio Conejos] five miles more, S. 60° W., when
we went round through a chain of hills and bore off to the
south. We proceeded nine miles further, when we crossed
the main branch of that stream, which was now bearing
nearly west toward [or east from] the main chain of the
third chain of mountains [San Juan range]. We encamped
on the opposite side. Intensely cold; obliged to stop
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">596</a></span>
frequently and make fires. Snow deep. Distance 15
[5 + 9 = 14] miles.<a name="FNanchor_IP-1" id="FNanchor_IP-1" href="#Footnote_IP-1" class="fnanchor">[I'-1]</a></p>

<p><i>Feb. 28th.</i> We marched late. One of the Frenchmen
informed me that the expedition which had been at the
Pawnees had descended the Red river 233 leagues, and
from thence crossed to the Pawnees expressly in search of
my party. This was afterward confirmed by the gentleman
who commanded the troops. He then expressed great
regret at my misfortunes, as he termed them, in being taken,
and offered his services in secreting papers, etc. I took him
at his word, and for my amusement thought I would try
him; so I gave him a leaf or two of my journal, copied,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">597</a></span>
which mentioned the time of my sailing from Belle Fontaine,
and our force. This I charged him to guard very
carefully and give to me after the investigation of my
papers at Santa Fe. This day we saw a herd of wild
horses. The Spaniards pursued them and caught two
colts, one of which the Indians killed and ate; the other
was let go. We pursued our journey over some hills, where
the snow was very deep, and encamped at last on the top
of a pretty high hill, among some pines. We left the river,
which in general ran about six, eight, and 10 miles to the
left or east of us. Saw great sign of elk. Distance 36
miles.<a name="FNanchor_IP-2" id="FNanchor_IP-2" href="#Footnote_IP-2" class="fnanchor">[I'-2]</a></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Mar. 1st.</i> We marched early. Although we
rode very hard we only got to the village of L'eau Chaud,
or Warm Spring [Ojo Caliente], some time in the afternoon.
The distance was about 45 miles. The difference of climate
was astonishing; after we left the hills and deep snows, we
found ourselves on plains where there was no snow, and
where vegetation was sprouting.</p>

<p>The village of Warm Springs, or Aqua [Agua] Caliente
in their language, is situated on the eastern branch [bank] of
a creek of that name,<a name="FNanchor_IP-3" id="FNanchor_IP-3" href="#Footnote_IP-3" class="fnanchor">[I'-3]</a> and at a distance presents to the eye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">598</a></span>
a square inclosure of mud walls, the houses forming the
walls. They are flat on top, or with extremely little ascent
on one side, where there are spouts to carry off the water of
the melting snow and rain when it falls; which, we were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">599</a></span>
informed, had been but once in two years previous to our
entering the country. Inside of the inclosure were the different
streets of houses of the same fashion, all of one story;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">600</a></span>
the doors were narrow, the windows small, and in one or
two houses there were talc lights [window-panes of that
material]. This village had a mill near it, situated on the
little creek, which made very good flour. The population
consisted of civilized Indians, but much mixed blood.</p>

<p>Here we had a dance which is called the fandango; but
there was one which was copied from the Mexicans, is now
danced in the first societies of New Spain, and has even
been introduced at the court of Madrid.</p>

<p>This village may contain 500 souls. The greatest natural
curiosity is the warm springs, which are two in number,
about 10 yards apart, each affording sufficient water for a
mill-seat. They appeared to be impregnated with copper,
and were more than 33° above blood heat. From this
village the Tetaus drove off 2,000 horses at one time, when
at war with the Spaniards.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 2d.</i> We marched late, and passed several little
mud-walled villages and settlements, all of which had round
mud towers of the ancient shape and construction, to defend
the inhabitants from the intrusions of the savages. I was
this day shown the ruins of several old villages which had
been taken and destroyed by the Tetaus. We were frequently
stopped by the women, who invited us into their
houses to eat; and in every place where we halted a
moment there was a contest who should be our hosts. My
poor lads who had been frozen were conducted home by
old men, who would cause their daughters to dress their
feet, provide their victuals and drink, and at night give
them the best bed in the house. In short, all their conduct
brought to my recollection the hospitality of the ancient
patriarchs, and caused me to sigh with regret at the corruption
of that noble principle by the polish of modern ages.</p>

<p>We descended the creek of Aqua Caliente about 12 miles,
where it joined the river of Conejos [Rio Chama<a name="FNanchor_IP-4" id="FNanchor_IP-4" href="#Footnote_IP-4" class="fnanchor">[I'-4]</a>]
from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">601</a></span>
west. This river was about 30 yards wide, and was settled
for 12 miles above its junction with the Aqua Caliente, as
the latter was in its whole course from the village of that
name. From where they form a junction it was about 15
miles to the Rio del Norte, on the eastern branch [read
bank] of which was situated the village of St. John's [San
Juan], which was the residence of the president priest of
the province, who had resided in it 40 years.</p>

<p>The house-tops of the village of St. John's were crowded,
as well as the streets, when we entered, and at the door of
the public quarters we were met by the president priest.
When my companion, who commanded the escort, received
him in a street and embraced him, all the poor creatures
who stood round strove to kiss the ring or hand of the holy
father; for myself, I saluted him in the usual style. My
men were conducted into the quarters, and I went to the
house of the priest, where we were treated with politeness.
He offered us coffee, chocolate, or whatever we thought
proper, and desired me to consider myself at home in his
house.</p>

<p>As I was going, some time after, to the quarters of my
men, I was addressed at the door by a man in broken English:
"My friend, I am very sorry to see you here; we are
all prisoners in this country and can never return; I have
been a prisoner for nearly three years, and cannot get out."
I replied: "that as for his being a prisoner, it must be for
some crime; that with respect to myself I felt no apprehension;
and requested him to speak French, as I could hardly
understand his English." He began to demand of me so
many different questions on the mode of my getting into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">602</a></span>
the country, my intention, etc., that by the time I arrived in
the room of my men, I was perfectly satisfied of his having
been ordered by some person to endeavor to obtain some
confession or acknowledgment of sinister designs in my having
appeared on the frontiers, and some confidential communications
which might implicate me. As he had been
rather insolent in his inquiries, I ordered my men to shut
and fasten the door. I then told him that I believed him
to be an emissary sent on purpose by the governor, or some
person, to endeavor to betray me; that all men of that
description were scoundrels, and never should escape punishment,
whilst I possessed the power to chastise them&mdash;immediately
ordering my men to seize him, and cautioning
him, at the same time, that, if he cried out, or made the
least resistance, I would be obliged to make use of the saber
which I had in my hand. On this he was so much alarmed,
that he begged me for God's sake not to injure him; he also
said that he had been ordered by the government to meet
me, and endeavor to trace out what and who I was, and
what were my designs, by endeavoring to produce a confidence
in him, by his exclaiming against the Spaniards and
complaining of the tyranny which they had exercised toward
him. After this confession, I ordered my men to release
him, and told him that I looked upon him as too contemptible
for further notice; but that he might tell the governor,
the next time he employed emissaries, to choose those of
more abilities and sense; and that I questioned if his Excellency
would find the sifting of us an easy task.</p>

<p>This man's name was Baptiste Lalande;<a name="FNanchor_IP-5" id="FNanchor_IP-5" href="#Footnote_IP-5" class="fnanchor">[I'-5]</a> he had come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">603</a></span>
from the Illinois to the Pawnees, to trade with goods furnished
him by William Morrison, a gentleman of the Illinois,
and thence to New Mexico with the goods which he
had procured, and established himself; he was the same man
on whom Robinson had a claim. He returned into the
priest's house with me, and, instead of making any complaint,
he in reply to their inquiries of who I was, etc., informed
them that when he left Louisiana I was governor of
the Illinois. This I presume he took for granted from my
having commanded for some time the post of Kaskaskias,
the first military post the United States had established in
that country since the peace; however, the report served
to add to the respect with which my companion and host
treated me.</p>

<p>I had at this place the first good meal, wine, etc., which, with
the heat of the house, and perhaps rather an immoderate use
of the refreshments allowed me, produced an attack of something
like cholera morbus, which alarmed me considerably,
and made me determine to be more abstemious in future.</p>

<p>This father was a great naturalist, or rather florist; he had
large collections of flowers, plants, etc., and several works
on his favorite studies, the margins and bottoms of which
were filled with his notes in the Castilian language. As I
neither had a natural turn for botany sufficient to induce
me to puzzle my head much with the Latin, nor understood
Castilian, I enjoyed but little of the lectures which he continued
to give me for nearly two hours on those subjects;
but, by the exercise of a small degree of patience, I entirely
acquired the esteem of this worthy father, he calling me
his son, and lamenting extremely that my faith had not
made me one of the holy Catholic church.</p>

<p>The father, being informed that I had some astronomical
instruments with me, expressed a desire to see them. All
that I had here was my sextant and a large glass which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">604</a></span>
magnified considerably, calculated for the day or night;
the remainder of my instruments being with my sergeant
and party. On his examining the sextant, and my showing
him the effect of it in the reflection of the sun, he,
as well as hundreds who surrounded us, appeared more surprised
at the effect of the instrument than any nation of
savages I was ever among. Here an idea struck me as
extraordinary&mdash;how a man who appeared to be a perfect
master of the ancient languages, a botanist, mineralogist,
and chemist, should be so ignorant of the powers of reflection
and the first principles of mathematics. But my friend
explained that enigma, by informing me of the care the
Spanish government took to prevent any branch of science
from being made a pursuit, which would have a tendency
to extend the views of the subjects of the provinces to the
geography of their country, or any other subject which
would bring to view a comparison of their local advantages
and situations with other countries.<a name="FNanchor_IP-6" id="FNanchor_IP-6" href="#Footnote_IP-6" class="fnanchor">[I'-6]</a></p>

<p>St. John's was inclosed with a mud wall, and probably
contained 1,000 souls; its population consisted principally
of civilized Indians, as indeed does that of all the villages
of New Mexico, the whites not forming one-twentieth part
of the inhabitants.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 3d.</i><a name="FNanchor_IP-7" id="FNanchor_IP-7" href="#Footnote_IP-7" class="fnanchor">[I'-7]</a> We marched after breakfast, B. Lalande accompanying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">605</a></span>
us, and in about six miles came to a village
[Santa Cruz], where I suppose there were more than 2,000
souls. Here we halted at the house of a priest, who, understanding
that I would not kiss his hand, would not present
it to me. The conduct and behavior of a young priest
who came in was such as in our country would have been
amply sufficient forever to have banished him from the
clerical association&mdash;strutting about with a dirk in his boot,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">606</a></span>
a cane in his hand, whispering to one girl, chucking another
under the chin, going out with a third, etc.</p>

<p>From this village [Santa Cruz] to another small village
[Pojoaque], of 500 inhabitants, is seven miles. At each of
those villages is a small stream, sufficient for the purpose of
watering their fields. At the father's house we took coffee.
From this village [Pojoaque] it was 17 miles to another
[Tesuque], of 400 civilized Indians. Here we changed
horses and prepared for entering the capital [Santa Fé<a name="FNanchor_IP-8" id="FNanchor_IP-8" href="#Footnote_IP-8" class="fnanchor">[I'-8]</a>],
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">607</a></span>
which we came in sight of in the evening. It is situated
along the banks of a small [Santa Fé] creek, which comes
down from the mountains, and runs west to the Rio del
Norte. The length of the capital on the creek may be
estimated at one mile; it is but three streets in width.</p>

<p>Its appearance from a distance struck my mind with the
same effect as a fleet of the flat-bottomed boats which are
seen in the spring and fall seasons, descending the Ohio
river. There are two churches, the magnificence of whose
steeples form a striking contrast to the miserable appearance
of the houses.<a name="FNanchor_IP-9" id="FNanchor_IP-9" href="#Footnote_IP-9" class="fnanchor">[I'-9]</a> On the north side of the town is the
square of soldiers' houses, equal to 120 or 140 on each flank.
The public square is in the center of the town; on the
north side of it is situated the palace, as they term it, or
government house, with the quarters for guards, etc. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">608</a></span>
other side of the square is occupied by the clergy and public
officers. In general the houses have a shed before the
front, some of which have a flooring of brick; the consequence
is that the streets are very narrow, say in general
25 feet. The supposed population is 4,500 souls. On our
entering the town the crowd was great, and followed us to
the government house. When we dismounted we were
ushered in through various rooms, the floors of which were
covered with skins of buffalo, bear, or some other animal.
We waited in a chamber for some time, until his Excellency
appeared, when we rose, and the following conversation
took place in French:</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> Do you speak French?</p>

<p><i>Pike.</i> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> You come to reconnoiter our country, do you?</p>

<p><i>Pike.</i> I marched to reconnoiter our own.</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> In what character are you?</p>

<p><i>Pike.</i> In my proper character, an officer of the United
States army.</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> And this Robinson&mdash;is he attached to your
party?</p>

<p><i>Pike.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> Do you know him?</p>

<p><i>Pike.</i> Yes; he is from St. Louis. (I understood the doctor
had been sent 45 leagues from Santa Fe, under a strong
guard. The haughty and unfriendly reception of the governor
induced me to believe war must have been declared, and
that if it were known Dr. Robinson had accompanied me, he
would be treated with great severity. I was correct in saying
he was not attached to my party, for he was only a volunteer,
who could not properly be said to be one of my command.)</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> How many men have you?</p>

<p><i>Pike.</i> Fifteen.</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> And this Robinson makes sixteen?</p>

<p><i>Pike.</i> I have already told your Excellency that he does
not belong to my party, and shall answer no more interrogatories
on that subject.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">609</a></span></p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> When did you leave St. Louis?</p>

<p><i>Pike.</i> July 15th.</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> I think you marched in June.</p>

<p><i>Pike.</i> No, sir!</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> Well! Return with Mr. Bartholomew to his
house; come here again at seven o'clock, and bring your
papers.</p>

<p>On which we returned to the house of my friend Bartholomew,
who seemed much hurt at the interview.</p>

<p>At the door of the government house, I met the old
Frenchman to whom I had given the scrap of paper on the
27th of February. He had left us in the morning, and, as I
suppose, hurried in to make his report, and I presume had
presented this paper to his Excellency. I demanded, with a
look of contempt, if he had made his report? To which
he made reply in a humble tone, and began to excuse himself;
but I did not wait to hear his excuses. At the hour
appointed we returned, when the governor demanded my
papers. I told him that I understood my trunk had been
taken possession of by his guard. He expressed surprise,
immediately ordered it in, and also sent for one Solomon
Colly, formerly a sergeant in our army, and one of the unfortunate
company of [Captain Philip] Nolan. We were
seated, when he ordered Colly to demand my name, to
which I replied. He then demanded in what province I
was born. I answered in English, and then addressed his
Excellency in French, and told him that I did not think it
necessary to enter into such a catechising; that if he would
be at the pains of reading my commission from the United
States, and my orders from my general, it would be all that
I presumed would be necessary to convince his Excellency
that I came with no hostile intentions toward the Spanish
government; that, on the contrary, I had express instructions
to guard against giving them offense or alarm; and
that his Excellency would be convinced that myself and
party were rather to be considered objects on which the so
much celebrated generosity of the Spanish nation might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">610</a></span>
exercised, than proper subjects to occasion the opposite
sentiments.</p>

<p>He then requested to see my commission and orders,
which I read to him in French; on which he got up and
gave me his hand, for the first time, and said he was happy
to be acquainted with me as a man of honor and a gentleman;
that I could retire this evening and take my trunk
with me; and that on the morrow he would make further
arrangements.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 4th.</i> I was desired by the governor to bring up my
trunk, in order that he might make some observations on my
route, etc. When he ordered me to take my trunk over
night, I had conceived that the examination of papers was
over. As many of my documents were intrusted to the
care of my men, and I found that the inhabitants were treating
the men with liquor, I was fearful they would become
intoxicated, and through inadvertency betray or discover
the papers. I had therefore obtained several of them and
put them in the trunk, when an officer arrived for myself
and it, and I had no opportunity of taking them out again
before I was taken up to the palace. I discovered instantly
that I had been deceived, but it was too late to remedy
the evil.</p>

<p>After examining the contents of my trunk, he informed
me that I must, with my troops, go to Chihuahua, province
of Biscay, to appear before the commandant-general. He
added: "You have the key of your trunk in your own possession;
the trunk will be put under charge of the officer
who commands your escort." The following conversation
then took place:</p>

<p><i>Pike.</i> If we go to Chihuahua we must be considered as
prisoners of war?</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> By no means.</p>

<p><i>Pike.</i> You have already disarmed my men without my
knowledge; are their arms to be returned or not?</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> They can receive them any moment.</p>

<p><i>Pike.</i> But, sir, I cannot consent to be led three or four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">611</a></span>
hundred leagues out of my route, without its being by force
of arms.</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> I know you do not go voluntarily; but I will
give you a certificate from under my hand of my having
obliged you to march.</p>

<p><i>Pike.</i> I will address you a letter on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_IP-10" id="FNanchor_IP-10" href="#Footnote_IP-10" class="fnanchor">[I'-10]</a></p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> You will dine with me to-day, and march
afterward to a village about six miles distant, escorted by
Captain Anthony D'Almansa, with a detachment of dragoons,
who will accompany you to where the remainder of
your escort is now waiting for you, under the command of
the officer [Don Facundo Malgares] who commanded the
expedition to the Pawnees.</p>

<p><i>Pike.</i> I would not wish to be impertinent in my observations
to your Excellency; but pray, sir! do you not think it
was a greater infringement of our territory to send 600 miles
in the Pawnees', than for me with our small party to come
on the frontiers of yours with an intent to descend Red
river?</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> I do not understand you.</p>

<p><i>Pike.</i> No, sir! any further explanation is unnecessary.</p>

<p>I then returned to the house of my friend Bartholomew
and wrote my letter to his Excellency, which I had not
finished before we were hurried to dinner.</p>

<p>In the morning I received from the governor, by the
hands of his private secretary, $21, notifying to me that it
was the amount of the king's allowance for my party to Chihuahua,
and that it would be charged to me on account of
my subsistence. From this I clearly understood that it was
calculated that the expenses of the party to Chihuahua
would be defrayed by the United States. I also received by
the same hands, from his Excellency, a shirt and neck-cloth,
with his compliments, wishing me to accept of them, "as
they had been made in Spain by his sister and never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">612</a></span>
worn by any person." For this I returned him my sincere
acknowledgments; and it may not be deemed irrelevant if
I explain at this period the miserable appearance we made,
and the situation we were in, with the causes of it.</p>

<p>When we left our interpreter and one man [Vasquez and
Smith] on the Arkansaw, we were obliged to carry all our baggage
on our backs; consequently, that which was the most
useful was preferred to the few ornamental parts of dress we
possessed. The ammunition claimed our first care; tools
were secondary; leather, leggings, boots, and mockinsons
were the next in consideration. Consequently, I left all my
uniform, clothing, trunks, etc., as did the men, except what
they had on their backs; conceiving that which would secure
the feet and legs from the cold to be preferable to any less
indispensable portion of our dress. Thus, when we presented
ourselves at Santa Fe, I was dressed in a pair of blue trousers,
mockinsons, blanket coat, and a cap made of scarlet cloth
lined with fox-skin; my poor fellows were in leggings, breech
cloths and leather coats, and there was not a hat in the
whole party. This appearance was extremely mortifying to
us all, especially as soldiers; although some of the officers
used frequently to observe to me, that "worth made the
man," etc., with a variety of adages to the same amount.
Yet the first impression made on the ignorant is hard to
eradicate; and a greater proof cannot be given of the ignorance
of the common people, than their asking if we lived in
houses, or in camps like the Indians, and if we wore hats in
our country. Those observations are sufficient to show the
impression our uncouth appearance made amongst them.</p>

<p>The dinner at the governor's was rather splendid, having a
variety of dishes and wines of the southern provinces; and
when his Excellency was a little warmed with the influence of
cheering liquor, he became very sociable. He informed me
that there existed a serious difficulty between the commandant-general
of the internal provinces and the Marquis Caso
Calvo, who had given permission to Mr. [William] Dunbar
to explore the Ouchata [Washita], contrary to the general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">613</a></span>
principles of their government; in consequence of which the
former had made representations against the latter to the
court of Madrid. After dinner his Excellency ordered his
coach; Captain D'Almansa, Bartholomew, and myself
entered with him, and he drove out three miles. He was
drawn by six mules and attended by a guard of cavalry.
When we parted his adieu was, "remember Allencaster, in
peace or war."</p>

<p>I left a note for my sergeant, with instructions to keep up
good discipline and not be alarmed or discouraged. As I
was about leaving the public square, poor Colly, the American
prisoner, came up with tears in his eyes, and hoped I
would not forget him when I arrived in the United States.</p>

<p>After we left the governor we rode on about three miles
to a defile, where we halted for the troops. I soon found
that the old soldier who accompanied us and commanded
our escort was fond of a drop of the cheering liquor, as his
boy carried a bottle in his cochmelies [read cojinillos], a
small leather case attached to the saddle for the purpose
of carrying small articles.<a name="FNanchor_IP-11" id="FNanchor_IP-11" href="#Footnote_IP-11" class="fnanchor">[I'-11]</a> We were accompanied by my
friend Bartholomew. We ascended a hill and galloped on
until about ten o'clock; it was snowing hard all the time.
Then we came to a precipice, which we descended with
great difficulty, from the obscurity of the night, to the
small village,<a name="FNanchor_IP-12" id="FNanchor_IP-12" href="#Footnote_IP-12" class="fnanchor">[I'-12]</a> where we put up in the quarters of the priest,
he being absent.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">614</a></span></p>

<p>After supper, Captain D'Almansa related to me that he
had served his Catholic majesty 40 years to arrive at the
rank he then held, which was that of a first lieutenant in the
line and a captain by brevet, whilst he had seen various
young Europeans promoted over his head. After the old
man had taken his <i>quantum sufficit</i> and gone to sleep, my
friend and myself sat up for some hours, he explaining to
me their situation, the great desire they felt for a change of
affairs and an open trade with the United States. I pointed
out to him with chalk on the floor the geographical connection
and route from North Mexico and Louisiana, and
finally gave him a certificate addressed to the citizens of the
United States, stating his friendly disposition and his being
a man of influence. This paper he seemed to estimate as a
very valuable acquisition, as he was decidedly of opinion we
would invade that country the ensuing spring; and not all
my assurances to the contrary could eradicate that idea.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 5th.</i> As it snowed very hard in the morning, we did
not march until eleven o'clock. In the meantime, Bartholomew
and myself paid a visit to an old invalid Spaniard, who
received us in the most hospitable manner, giving us chocolate,
etc. He made many inquiries as to our government
and religion, and of [Bartholomew], who did not fail to give
them the brightest coloring; he being enthusiastic in their
favor from his many conversations with me, and drawing
comparisons with his own country. What appeared to the
old veteran most extraordinary was that we ever changed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">615</a></span>
our president. I was obliged to draw his powers on a
nearer affinity with those of a monarch than they really are,
in order that they might comprehend his station and that
there was a perfect freedom of conscience permitted in our
country. He, however, expressed his warm approbation of
the measure. In the priest's house at which we put up
were two orphan girls, who were adopted by him in their
infancy and at this time constituted his whole family.</p>

<p>I bid adieu to my friend Bartholomew, and could not
avoid shedding tears; he embraced me and all my men.</p>

<p>We arrived at the village of St. Domingo<a name="FNanchor_IP-13" id="FNanchor_IP-13" href="#Footnote_IP-13" class="fnanchor">[I'-13]</a> at two o'clock.
It is, as I supposed, nine miles [to this place, which is situated]
on the east side of the Rio del Norte, and is a large
village, the population being about 1,000 natives, generally
governed by its own chief. The chiefs of the villages were
distinguished by a cane with a silver head and black tassel.
On our arrival at the public house Captain D'Almansa was
waited on by the governor, cap in hand, to receive his orders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">616</a></span>
as to furnishing our quarters and ourselves with wood,
water, provisions, etc. The house itself contained nothing
but bare walls and small grated windows, which brought to
my recollection the representations of the Spanish inhabitants
given by Dr. [John] Moore [the Scottish writer,
1730-1802], in his travels through Spain, Italy, etc. This
village, as well as those of St. Philip's and St. Bartholomew,
[San Felipe and San Bartolomé] is of the nation of Keres
[or Queres] many of whom do not yet speak good Spanish.</p>

<p>After we had refreshed ourselves a little, the captain sent
for the keys of the church; and when we entered it, I was
much astonished to find, inclosed in mud-brick walls, many
rich paintings, and the saint (Domingo) as large as life,
elegantly ornamented with gold and silver. The captain
made a slight inclination of the head, and intimated to me
that this was the patron of the village. We then ascended
into the gallery, where the choir are generally placed. In
an outside hall was placed another image of the saint, less
richly ornamented, where the populace repaired daily and
knelt to return thanks for benefactions received, or to ask
new favors. Many young girls, indeed, chose the time of
our visit to be on their knees before the holy patron. From
the flat roof of the church we had a delightful view of the
village; the Rio del Norte [and Jemez mountains] on the
west; the mountains of St. Dies [San Diaz, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, Sandia] to
the south; the valley round the town, on which were numerous
herds of goats, sheep, and asses&mdash;upon the whole,
this was one of the handsomest views in New Mexico.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 6th.</i> Marched down the Rio del Norte on the east
side. Snow one foot deep. Passed large flocks of goats.
At [opposite] the village of St. Philip's [San Felipe<a name="FNanchor_IP-14" id="FNanchor_IP-14" href="#Footnote_IP-14" class="fnanchor">[I'-14]</a>] we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">617</a></span>
crossed [the Rio Grande to the town over] a bridge of eight
arches, constructed as follows: the pillars made of neat
woodwork, something similar to a crate, and in the form of
a keel-boat, the sharp end or bow to the current; this crate
or butment was filled with stone, in which the river lodged
sand, clay, etc., until it had become of a tolerably firm consistency.
On the top of the pillars were laid pine logs,
lengthways, squared on two sides; being joined pretty
close, these made a tolerable bridge for horses, but would
not have been very safe for carriages, as there were no
hand-rails.</p>

<p>On our arrival at the house of the father, we were received
in a very polite and friendly manner; and before my departure
we seemed to have been friends for years past. During
our dinner, at which we had a variety of wines, we were
entertained with music, composed of bass drums, French
horns, violins, and cymbals. We likewise entered into a
long and candid conversation as to the Creoles, wherein he
spared neither the government nor its administrators. As
to government and religion, Father Rubi displayed a liberality
of opinion and a fund of knowledge which astonished
me. He showed me a statistical table on which he had, in
a regular manner, taken the whole province of New Mexico
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">618</a></span>
by villages, beginning at Tous [Taos], on the northwest, and
ending with Valencia on the south, giving their latitude,
longitude, and population, whether natives or Spaniards,
civilized or barbarous, Christians or pagans, numbers, names
of the nations, when converted, how governed, military force,
clergy, salary, etc.&mdash;in short, a complete geographical, statistical,
and historical sketch of the province. Of this I wished
to obtain a copy, but perceived that the captain was somewhat
surprised at its having been shown to me. When we
parted, we promised to write to each other, which I performed
from Chihuahua.</p>

<p>Here was an old Indian who was extremely inquisitive
to know if we were Spaniards; to which an old gentleman
called Don Francisco, who appeared to be an inmate of
Father Rubi's, replied in the affirmative. "But," said the
Indian, "they do not speak Castillian." "True," replied
the other; "but you are an Indian of the nation of Keres, are
you not?" "Yes." "Well, the Utahs are Indians also?"
"Yes." "But still you do not understand them, they speaking
a different language." "True," replied the Indian.
"Well," said the old gentleman, "those strangers are likewise
Spaniards, but do not speak the same language with
us." This reasoning seemed to satisfy the poor savage;
and I could not but smile at the ingenuity displayed to
make him believe there was no other nation of whites but
the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Whilst at dinner, Father Rubi was informed that one of
his parishioners was at the point of death, and wished his
attendance to receive his confession.</p>

<p>We took our departure, but were shortly after overtaken
by our friend, who, after giving me another hearty shake of
the hand, left us. Crossed the river and passed two small
hamlets and houses on the road to the village of St. Dies,<a name="FNanchor_IP-15" id="FNanchor_IP-15" href="#Footnote_IP-15" class="fnanchor">[I'-15]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">619</a></span>
opposite the mountain of the same name, where we were
received in a house of Father Rubi, this making part of his
domains.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 7th.</i> Marched at nine o'clock through a country
better cultivated and inhabited than any I had yet seen.
Arrived at Albuquerque,<a name="FNanchor_IP-16" id="FNanchor_IP-16" href="#Footnote_IP-16" class="fnanchor">[I'-16]</a> a village on the east side of the
Rio del Norte. We were received by Father Ambrosio
Guerra in a very flattering manner, and led into his hall.
From thence, after taking some refreshments, we went into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">620</a></span>
an inner apartment, where he ordered his adopted children
of the female sex to appear. They came in by turns&mdash;Indians
of various nations, Spanish, French, and finally two
young girls, whom from their complexion I conceived to be
English. On perceiving I noticed them, he ordered the rest
to retire, many of whom were beautiful, and directed those
to sit down on the sofa beside me. Thus situated, he told
me that they had been taken to the east by the Tetaus and
passed from one nation to another, until he purchased them,
at that time infants; they could recollect neither their
names nor language, but, concluding they were my countrywomen,
he ordered them to embrace me as a mark of their
friendship, to which they appeared nothing loath. We then
sat down to dinner, which consisted of various dishes, excellent
wines, and, to crown all, we were waited on by half
a dozen of those beautiful girls who, like Hebe at the feast
of the gods, converted our wine to nectar, and with their
ambrosial breath shed incense on our cups. After the cloth
was removed some time, the priest beckoned me to follow
him, and led me into his sanctum sanctorum, where he had
the rich and majestic images of various saints, and in the
midst the crucified Jesus, crowned with thorns, with rich
rays of golden glory surrounding his head&mdash;in short, the
room being hung with black silk curtains, served but to augment
the gloom and majesty of the scene. When he conceived
my imagination sufficiently wrought up, he put on
a black gown and miter, kneeled before the cross, took hold
of my hand, and endeavored gently to pull me down beside
him. On my refusal, he prayed fervently for a few minutes
and then rose, laid his hands on my shoulders, and, as I conceived,
blessed me. He then said to me, "You will not be a
Christian. Oh! what a pity! oh! what a pity!" He then
threw off his robes, took me by the hand and led me out of
the company smiling; but the scene I had gone through had
made too serious an impression on my mind to be eradicated
until we took our departure, which was in an hour after,
having received great marks of friendship from the father.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">621</a></span></p>

<p>Both above and below Albuquerque, the citizens were
beginning to open canals, to let in the water of the river to
fertilize the plains and fields which border its banks on both
sides; where we saw men, women, and children, of all ages
and sexes, at the joyful labor which was to crown with rich
abundance their future harvest and insure them plenty for
the ensuing year. Those scenes brought to my recollection
the bright descriptions given by Savary of the opening of
the canals of Egypt. The cultivation of the fields was
commencing and everything appeared to give life and gayety
to the surrounding scenery.</p>

<p>We crossed the Rio del Norte [at Atrisco<a name="FNanchor_IP-17" id="FNanchor_IP-17" href="#Footnote_IP-17" class="fnanchor">[I'-17]</a>], a little below
the village of Albuquerque, where it was 400 yards wide,
but not more than three feet deep and excellent fording.
At Father Ambrosio's was the only chart we saw in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">622</a></span>
province that gave the near connection of the sources of
the Rio del Norte and the Rio Colorado of California, with
their ramifications.</p>

<p>On our arriving at the next village, a dependency of
Father Ambrosio's, we were invited into the house of the
commandant. When I entered, I saw a man sitting by the
fire reading a book; with blooming cheeks, fine complexion,
and a genius-speaking eye, he arose from his seat. It was
Robinson! Not that Robinson who left my camp on the
headwaters of the Rio del Norte, pale, emaciated, with uncombed
locks and beard of eight months' growth, but with
fire, unsubdued enterprise, and fortitude. The change was
indeed surprising. I started back and exclaimed, "Robinson!"
"Yes." "But I do not know you," I replied. "But
I know you," he exclaimed; "I would not be unknown to
you here, in this land of tyranny and oppression, to avoid
all the pains they dare to inflict. Yet, my friend, I grieve
to see you here and thus, for I presume you are a prisoner."
I replied "No! I wear my sword, you see; all my men
have their arms, and the moment they dare to ill-treat us we
will surprise their guards in the night, carry off some horses,
make our way to Appaches, and then set them at defiance."</p>

<p>At this moment Captain D'Almansa entered, and I introduced
Robinson to him as my <i>companion de voyage</i> and
friend, he having before seen him at Santa Fe. He did not
appear much surprised, and received him with a significant
smile, as much as to say, "I knew this." We then marched
out to the place where the soldiers were encamped, not one
of whom would recognize him, agreeably to orders, until
I gave them the sign. Then it was a joyful meeting, as the
whole party was enthusiastically fond of him. He gave me
the following relation of his adventures after he left me:</p>

<p>"I marched the first day up the branch [Rio Conejos] on
which we were situated, as you know we had concluded it
would be most proper to follow it to its source and then
cross the mountains [San Juan range] west, where we had
conceived we should find the Spanish settlements, and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">623</a></span>
night encamped on its banks. The second day I left it
a little, bore more south, and was getting up the side of the
mountain, when I discovered two Indians, for whom I made.
They were armed with bows and arrows, and were extremely
shy of my approach; but after some time, confidence being
somewhat restored, I signified a wish to go to Santa Fe,
when they pointed due south, down the river I left you on.
As I could not believe them, I reiterated the inquiry and
received the same reply. I then concluded that we had
been deceived, and that you were on the Rio del Norte,
instead of the Red river. I was embarrassed whether I
should not immediately return to apprise you of it; but
concluded it to be too late, as I was discovered by the
Indians, whom if I had not met, or some others, I should
have continued on, crossed the mountains to the waters of
the Colorado, and descended these, until from their course
I should have discovered my mistake. I therefore offered
them some presents to conduct me in; they agreed, conducted
me to the camp where their women were, and in
about five minutes we were on our march. That night we
encamped in the woods; I slept very little, owing to my
distrust of my companions. The next day, at three o'clock,
we arrived at the village of Aqua Caliente, where I was
immediately taken into the house of the commandant, and
expresses were dispatched to Santa Fe. That night I was
put to sleep on a mattress on the floor. The next day we
departed early, leaving my arms and baggage at the commandant's,
he promising to have them forwarded to me at
the city. On our arrival at Santa Fe, the governor received
me with great austerity at first, entered into an examination
of my business, and took possession of all my papers.
After all this was explained, he ordered me to a room where
the officers were confined when under an arrest, and a non-commissioned
officer to attend me when I walked out into
the city, which I had free permission to do. I was supplied
with provisions from the governor's table, who had promised
he would write to Baptiste Lalande to come down and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">624</a></span>
answer to the claim I had against him; whose circumstance
I had apprised myself of. The second day the governor
sent for me, and informed me that he had made inquiry as
to the abilities of Lalande to discharge the debt, and found
that he possessed no property; but that at some future
period he would secure the money for me. To this I made
a spirited remonstrance, as an infringement of our treaties
and a protection of a refugee citizen of the United States
against his creditors. But it had no other effect than to
obtain me an invitation to dinner, and rather more respectful
treatment than I had hitherto received from his Excellency;
who, being slightly afflicted with dropsy, requested
my advice as to his case. For this I prescribed a regimen and
mode of treatment which happened to differ from the one
adopted by a monk and practicing physician of the place,
and thus brought on me his enmity and ill offices. The
ensuing day I was ordered by the governor to hold myself
in readiness to proceed to the internal parts of the country,
to which I agreed; determining not to leave the country in
a clandestine manner, unless they attempted to treat me
with indignity or hardship; and conceiving it in my power
to join you on your retreat, or find Red river and descend it,
should you not be brought in; but, in that case, to share
your destiny. Added to this I felt a desire to see more of
the country, for which purpose I was willing to run the risk
of future consequences. We marched the ensuing day,
I having been equipped by my friend with some small
articles of which I stood in need, such as I would receive
out of the numerous offers of his country. The fourth day
I arrived at the village of St. Fernandez, where I was
received and taken charge of by Lieutenant Don Faciendo
Malgares, who commanded the expedition to the Pawnees,
and whom you will find a gentleman, a soldier, and one of
the most gallant men you ever knew. With him I could no
longer keep up the disguise, and when he informed me, two
days since, that you were on the way in, I confessed to him
that I belonged to your party. We have ever since been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">625</a></span>
anticipating the pleasure we three will enjoy in our journey
to Chihuahua; for he is to command the escort, his dragoons
being now encamped in the field, awaiting your
arrival. Since I have been with him I have practiced
physic in the country in order to have an opportunity of
examining the manners, customs, etc., of the people, to
endeavor to ascertain their political and religious feelings,
and to gain every other species of information which would
be necessary to our country or ourselves. I am now here,
on a visit to this man's wife, attended by a corporal of
dragoons as a guard, who answers very well as a waiter,
guide, etc., in my excursions through the country; but
I will immediately return with you to Malgares."</p>

<p>Thus ended Robinson's relation, and I in return related
what had occurred to the party and myself. We agreed
upon our future line of conduct, and then joined my old
captain in the house. He had been persuaded to tarry all
night, provided it was agreeable to me, as our host wished
Robinson to remain until the next day. With this proposition
I complied, in order that Robinson and myself might
have a further discussion before we joined Malgares, who I
suspected would watch us closely. The troops proceeded to
the village of Tousac that evening.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Mar. 8th.</i> Marched after taking breakfast and
halted at a little village, three miles distant, called Tousac,<a name="FNanchor_IP-18" id="FNanchor_IP-18" href="#Footnote_IP-18" class="fnanchor">[I'-18]</a>
situated on the west side of the Rio del Norte. The men
informed me that, on their arrival over night, they had all
been furnished with an excellent supper; and after supper,
wine and a violin, with a collection of the young people to
a dance. When we left this village the priest sent a cart
down to carry us over, as the river was nearly four feet deep.
When we approached the village of St. Fernandez<a name="FNanchor_IP-19" id="FNanchor_IP-19" href="#Footnote_IP-19" class="fnanchor">[I'-19]</a> we were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">626</a></span>
met by Lieutenant Malgares, accompanied by two or three
other officers; he received with the most manly frankness
and the politeness of a man of the world. Yet my feelings
were such as almost overpowered me, and obliged me to
ride by myself for a short period in order to recover myself.
Those sensations arose from my knowledge that he had
been absent from Chihuahua ten months, and it had cost
the king of Spain more than $10,000 to effect that [capture
of myself and party] which a mere accident and the deception
of the governor had accomplished.</p>

<p>Malgares, finding I did not feel myself at ease, took every
means in his power to banish my reserve, which made it impossible
on my part not to endeavor to appear cheerful. We
conversed as well as we could, and in two hours were as well
acquainted as some people would be in the same number of
months. Malgares possessed none of the haughty Castillian
pride, but much of the urbanity of a Frenchman; and I will
add my feeble testimony to his loyalty, by declaring that he
was one of the few officers or citizens whom I found who
were loyal to their king, who felt indignant at the degraded
state of the Spanish monarchy, and who deprecated a revolution
or separation of Spanish America from the mother
country, unless France should usurp the government of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">627</a></span>
Spain. These are the men who possess the heads to plan,
the hearts to feel, and the hands to carry this great and important
work into execution. In the afternoon our friend
wrote the following notification to the alcaldes of several
small villages around us:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Send this evening six or eight of your handsomest young
girls to the village of St. Fernandez, where I propose giving
a fandango, for the entertainment of the American
officers arrived this day.</p>

<p class="left65">"[Signed] <span class="smcap">Don Faciendo</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>This order was punctually obeyed, and portrays more
clearly than a chapter of observations the degraded state of
the common people. In the evening, when the company
arrived, the ball began after their usual manner, and there
was really a handsome display of beauty.</p>

<p>It will be proper to mention here, that when my small
paper trunk was brought in, Lt. Malgares struck his foot
against it, and said: "The governor informs me this is a
prisoner of war, or that I have charge of it; but, sir, only
assure me that you will hold the papers therein contained
sacred, and I will have nothing to do with it." I bowed
assent; and I will only add that the condition was scrupulously
adhered to, as I was bound by every tie of military
and national honor, and, let me add, gratitude, not to abuse
his high confidence in the honor of a soldier. He further
added that "Robinson being now acknowledged as one of
your party, I shall withdraw his guard and consider him as
under your parole of honor." Those various marks of politeness
and friendship caused me to endeavor to evince to my
brother soldier that we were capable of appreciating his
honorable conduct toward us.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 9th.</i> The troops marched about ten o'clock. Lt.
Malgares and myself accompanied Captain D'Almansa about
three miles back on his route to Santa Fe, to the house of a
citizen, where we dined; after which we separated. I wrote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">628</a></span>
by the captain to the governor in French, and to Father
Rubi in English. D'Almansa presented me with his cap
and whip, and gave me a letter of recommendation to an
officer at Chihuahua. We returned to our quarters and,
being joined by our waiters, commenced our route.</p>

<p>Passed a village called St. Thomas [San Tomas, or
Tomé<a name="FNanchor_IP-20" id="FNanchor_IP-20" href="#Footnote_IP-20" class="fnanchor">[I'-20]</a>], one mile distant from camp. The camp was formed
in an ellipsis, the two long sides presenting a breastwork
formed of the saddles and heads of the mules, each end of
the ellipsis having a small opening to pass and repass at; in
the center was the commandant's tent. Thus, in case of an
attack on the camp, there were ready-formed works to fight
from. Malgares' mode of living was superior to anything
we have an idea of in our army; having eight mules loaded
with his common camp equipage, wines, confectionery, etc.
But this only served to evince the corruption of Spanish
discipline; for, if a subaltern indulged himself with such a
quantity of baggage, what would be the cavalcade attending
an army? Dr. Robinson had been called over the river
to a small village to see a sick woman, and did not return
that night. Distance 12 miles.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 10th.</i> Marched at eight o'clock, and arrived at the
village Sibilleta; passed on the way the village of Sabinez
on the west side, and Naxales, on the same [W.] side,
Sibilleta<a name="FNanchor_IP-21" id="FNanchor_IP-21" href="#Footnote_IP-21" class="fnanchor">[I'-21]</a> is situated on the east side, and is a regular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">629</a></span>
square, appearing like a large mud wall on the outside, the
doors, windows, etc., facing the square; it is the neatest and
most regular village I have yet seen, and is governed by a
sergeant, at whose quarters I put up.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">630</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mar. 11th.</i> Marched at eleven o'clock; came 12 miles<a name="FNanchor_IP-22" id="FNanchor_IP-22" href="#Footnote_IP-22" class="fnanchor">[I'-22]</a>
and encamped, the troops having preceded us. Lieutenant
Malgares, not being well, took medicine. The village we
stayed at last night being the last, we entered the wilderness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">631</a></span>
and the road became rough, small hills running into the
river, making valleys; but the bottoms appear richer than
those more to the north.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 12th.</i> Marched at seven o'clock; passed, on the west
side of the river, the mountains of Magdalen, and the Black
mountains on the east.<a name="FNanchor_IP-23" id="FNanchor_IP-23" href="#Footnote_IP-23" class="fnanchor">[I'-23]</a> Passed the encampment of a caravan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">632</a></span>
going out with about 15,000 sheep from the other provinces,
from which they bring back merchandise. This expedition
consisted of about 300 men, chiefly citizens, escorted
by an officer and 35 or 40 troops; they are collected at
Sibilleta and separate there on their return. They go out
in February and return in March; a similar expedition goes
out in the autumn, but during the other parts of the year no
citizen travels the road, the couriers excepted. At the pass
[El Paso] of the Rio del Norte they meet and exchange
packets, when both return to their own provinces. Met a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">633</a></span>
caravan of 50 men and probably 200 horses, loaded with
goods for New Mexico. Halted at twelve o'clock and
marched at three. Lt. Malgares showed me the place where
he had been in two affairs with the Appaches; one he commanded
himself, and the other was commanded by Captain
D'Almansa; in the former there were one Spaniard killed,
eight wounded, and 10 Appaches made prisoners; in the
latter 52 Appaches were wounded and 17 killed, they being
surprised in the night. Malgares killed two himself, and
had two horses killed under him.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 13th.</i> Marched at seven o'clock; saw many deer.
Halted at eleven o'clock and marched at four o'clock.<a name="FNanchor_IP-24" id="FNanchor_IP-24" href="#Footnote_IP-24" class="fnanchor">[I'-24]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">634</a></span></p>

<p>This day one of our horses threw a young woman and ran
off, as is the habit of all Spanish horses, if by chance they
throw their rider; many of the dragoons and Malgares
pursued him. Being mounted on an elegant horse of
Malgares', I joined in the chase, and notwithstanding
their superior horsemanship overtook the horse, caught his
bridle, and stopped him, when both of the horses were
nearly at full speed. This act procured me the applause
of the Spanish dragoons, and it is astonishing how much it
operated on their good will.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 14th.</i> Marched at ten o'clock, and halted at a
mountain ["of the Friar Christopher," <a href="#Page_639">p. 639</a>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, Fra Cristobal];
distance 10 miles.<a name="FNanchor_IP-25" id="FNanchor_IP-25" href="#Footnote_IP-25" class="fnanchor">[I'-25]</a> This is the point from which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">635</a></span>
the road leaves the river for two days' journey bearing due
south, the river here taking a turn southwest; by the river
it is five days to where the roads meet. We marched at
four o'clock, and eight miles below crossed the river to
the west side; two mules fell in the water. Unfortunately,
they carried the stores of Lieutenant Malgares, by which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">636</a></span>
means we lost all our bread, an elegant assortment of biscuits,
etc. Distance 18 miles.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Mar. 15th.</i> Marched at half past ten o'clock.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">637</a></span>
Made 28 miles, the route rough and stony; course S.
20° W.<a name="FNanchor_IP-26" id="FNanchor_IP-26" href="#Footnote_IP-26" class="fnanchor">[I'-26]</a></p>

<p><i>Mar. 16th.</i> Marched at seven o'clock, and halted at
twelve. Passed on the east side the Horse mountain, and
the Mountain of the Dead.<a name="FNanchor_IP-27" id="FNanchor_IP-27" href="#Footnote_IP-27" class="fnanchor">[I'-27]</a> Came on a trail of the appearance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">638</a></span>
of 200 horses, supposed to be the trail of an expedition
from the province of Biscay, against the Indians.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 17th.</i> Marched at ten o'clock, and at four in the
afternoon crossed the river to the east side; saw several
fresh Indian tracks; also, the trail of a large party of
horses, supposed to be Spanish troops in pursuit of the
Indians. Marched down the river 26 miles;<a name="FNanchor_IP-28" id="FNanchor_IP-28" href="#Footnote_IP-28" class="fnanchor">[I'-28]</a> fresh sign of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">639</a></span>
Indians, also of a party of horses. Country mountainous
on both sides of the river.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 18th.</i> Marched down the river 26 miles;<a name="FNanchor_IP-29" id="FNanchor_IP-29" href="#Footnote_IP-29" class="fnanchor">[I'-29]</a> fresh
sign of Indians, also of a party of horses. Country mountainous
on both sides of the river.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 19th.</i> Struck out east about three miles and fell
in with the main road [continuing from the Jornada del
Muerto], on a large flat prairie, which we left at the mountain
of the Friar Christopher.<a name="FNanchor_IP-30" id="FNanchor_IP-30" href="#Footnote_IP-30" class="fnanchor">[I'-30]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">640-641</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mar. 20th.</i> Halted at ten o'clock, at a salt lake. Marched
until two o'clock; halted for the day.<a name="FNanchor_IP-31" id="FNanchor_IP-31" href="#Footnote_IP-31" class="fnanchor">[I'-31]</a> Vegetation began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641"></a></span>
to be discoverable on the 17th, and this day the weeds and
grass were quite high.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 21st.</i> Marched in the morning and arrived at the
passo [El Paso<a name="FNanchor_IP-32" id="FNanchor_IP-32" href="#Footnote_IP-32" class="fnanchor">[I'-32]</a>] del Norte at eleven o'clock, the road leading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">642-645</a></span>
through a hilly and mountainous country. We put up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643"></a></span>
at the house of Don Francisco Garcia, who was a merchant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644"></a></span>
and a planter; he possessed in the vicinity of the town
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645"></a></span>
20,000 sheep and 1,000 cows. We were received in a most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">646-647</a></span>
hospitable manner by Don Pedro Roderique Rey, the lieutenant-governor,
and Father Joseph Prado, the vicar of the
place. This was by far the most flourishing place we had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647"></a></span>
been in. For a more particular account of its situation,
population, etc., see Appendix to Part III. [now <a href="#Page_718">Chap.
IV.</a>].

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">
ITINERARY, CONTINUED: THROUGH OLD MEXICO, IN CHIHUAHUA,
DURANGO, AND COAHUILA, TO THE PRESIDIO
GRANDE, MARCH 22D-MAY 31ST, 1807.
</span></h2>

<p><i>Sunday, Mar. 22d.</i> Remained at the Passo.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 23d.</i> Mass performed; left the Passo at three
o'clock, to Fort Elisiaira [Elizario], accompanied by the
lieutenant-governor, the vicar, and Allencaster, a brother of
the governor. Malgares, myself and the doctor took up our
quarters at the house of Capt. [Blank], who was then at Chihuahua;
but his lady and sister entertained us in a very elegant
and hospitable manner. They began playing cards and
continued until late the third day. Malgares, who won considerably,
would send frequently $15 or $20 from the table
to the lady of the house, her sister, and others, and beg
their acceptance, in order that the goddess of fortune might
still continue propitious; in this manner he distributed $500.</p>

<p>Around this fort were a great number of Appaches, who
were on a treaty with the Spaniards. These people appeared
to be perfectly independent in their manners, and
were the only savages I saw in the Spanish dominions whose
spirit was not humbled&mdash;whose necks were not bowed to the
yoke of their invaders. With those people Malgares was
extremely popular. I believe he sought popularity with
them and all the common people, for there was no man so
poor or so humble, under whose roof he would not enter;
when he walked out, I have seen him put a handful of dollars
in his pocket, and give them all to the old men, women,
and children before he returned to his quarters; but to
equals he was haughty and overbearing. This conduct he
pursued through the whole provinces of New Mexico and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">649</a></span>
Biscay, when at a distance from the seat of government;
but I could plainly perceive that he was cautious of his
conduct as he approached the capital [city of Chihuahua].
I here left a letter for my sergeant.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 24th.</i> Very bad weather.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 25th.</i> The troops marched, but Lt. Malgares and
my men remained.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 26th.</i> Divine service was performed in the morning,
in the garrison, at which all the troops attended under
arms. At one part of their mass, they present arms; at another,
sink on one knee and rest the muzzle of the gun on
the ground, in signification of their submission to their
divine master. At one o'clock, we bid adieu to our friendly
hostess, who was one of the finest women I had seen in New
Spain. At dusk arrived at a small pond made by a spring
which arose in the center, called the Ogo mall a Ukap, and
seemed formed by providence to enable the human race to
pass that route, as it was the only water within 60 miles
on the route. Here we overtook Sergeant Belardie with the
party of dragoons from Senora and Biscay, who had left us
at Fort Elisiaira, where we had received a new escort. Distance
20 miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-1" id="FNanchor_IIP-1" href="#Footnote_IIP-1" class="fnanchor">[II'-1]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">650</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mar. 27th.</i> Arrived at Carracal [Carrizal], at twelve
o'clock,<a name="FNanchor_IIP-2" id="FNanchor_IIP-2" href="#Footnote_IIP-2" class="fnanchor">[II'-2]</a> Distance 28 miles; the road well watered and
the situation pleasant. The father-in-law of our friend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">651</a></span>
commanded six or seven years here. When we arrived at
fort, the commandant, Don Pedro Rues Saramende, received
Robinson and myself with a cold bow, and informed Malgares
that we could repair to the public quarters. To this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">652</a></span>
Malgares indignantly replied that he should accompany us,
and turned to go, when the commandant took him by the
arm, made many apologies to him and us, and we at length
reluctantly entered his quarters. Here for the first time I
saw the gazettes of Mexico, which gave rumors of Colonel
[Aaron] Burr's conspiracies, the movements of our troops,
etc.; but which were stated in so vague and undefined
a manner as only to create our anxiety without throwing
any light on the subject.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 28th.</i> Marched at half past three o'clock, and arrived
at the Warm Springs [Ojos Calientes] at sundown;
crossed one little fosse on the route.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-3" id="FNanchor_IIP-3" href="#Footnote_IIP-3" class="fnanchor">[II'-3]</a></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Mar. 29th.</i> Marched at ten o'clock, and continued
our route, with but a short halt, until sundown, when
we encamped without water. Distance 30 miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-4" id="FNanchor_IIP-4" href="#Footnote_IIP-4" class="fnanchor">[II'-4]</a></p>

<p><i>Mar. 30th.</i> Marched before seven o'clock; the front
arrived at water at eleven o'clock; the mules, at twelve.
The spring<a name="FNanchor_IIP-5" id="FNanchor_IIP-5" href="#Footnote_IIP-5" class="fnanchor">[II'-5]</a> on the side of the mountain, to the east of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">653</a></span>
road, is a beautiful situation. I here saw the first ash timber
I observed in the country. This water is 52 miles from the
Warm Springs. Yesterday and to-day saw cabrie [antelope,
<i>Antilocapra americana</i>]. Marched 15 miles further and
encamped without wood or water; passed two other small
springs to the east of the road.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 31st.</i> Marched early and arrived at an excellent
spring at ten o'clock. The roads from Senora, Tanos
[qu: Yanos?], Buenaventura, etc., join about 400 yards
before you arrive at this spring.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-6" id="FNanchor_IIP-6" href="#Footnote_IIP-6" class="fnanchor">[II'-6]</a></p>

<p>Arrived at the village of [hiatus]<a name="FNanchor_IIP-7" id="FNanchor_IIP-7" href="#Footnote_IIP-7" class="fnanchor">[II'-7]</a> at night, a large and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">654</a></span>
elegant house, for the country; here were various labors
carried on by criminals in irons. We here met with a
Catalonian, who was but a short time from Spain, whose
dialect was such that he could scarcely be understood by
Malgares, and whose manners were much more like those
of a citizen of our Western frontiers than of a subject of
a despotic prince.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 1st.</i><a name="FNanchor_IIP-8" id="FNanchor_IIP-8" href="#Footnote_IIP-8" class="fnanchor">[II'-8]</a> In the morning Malgares dispatched a courier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">655</a></span>
with a letter to the Commandant-general Salcedo, to inform
him of our approach, and also one to his father-in-law.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 2d.</i> When we arrived at Chihuahua, we pursued
our course through the town to the house of the general.
I was much astonished to see with what anxiety Malgares
anticipated the meeting with his military chief. Having
been on the most arduous and enterprising expedition ever
undertaken by any of his Majesty's officers from these
provinces, and having executed it with equal spirit and
judgment, yet was he fearful of his [Salcedo's] meeting him
with an eye of displeasure. He appeared to be much more
agitated than ourselves, although we may be supposed to
have also had our sensations, as on the will of this man
depended our future destiny, at least until our country
could interfere in our behalf. On our arrival at the general's,
we were halted in the hall of the guard until word was sent
to the general of our arrival, when Malgares was first introduced.
He remained some time, during which a Frenchman
came up and endeavored to enter into conversation
with us, but was soon frowned into silence, as we conceived
he was only some authorized spy. Malgares at last came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">656</a></span>
out and asked me to walk in. I found the general sitting at
his desk; he was a middle-sized man, apparently about 55
years of age, with a stern countenance; but he received me
graciously and beckoned to a seat.</p>

<p>He then observed, "You have given us and yourself a
great deal of trouble."</p>

<p><i>Captain Pike.</i> On my part entirely unsought, and on
that of the Spanish government voluntary.</p>

<p><i>General Salcedo.</i> Where are your papers?</p>

<p><i>Captain Pike.</i> Under charge of Lieutenant Malgares.</p>

<p>Malgares was then ordered to have my small trunk
brought in, which being done, a Lieutenant Walker came in,
who is a native of New Orleans, his father an Englishman, his
mother a French woman, and who spoke both those languages
equally well, also the Spanish. He was a lieutenant of
dragoons in the Spanish service, and master of the military
school at Chihuahua. This same young gentleman was employed
by Mr. Andrew Ellicott,<a name="FNanchor_IIP-9" id="FNanchor_IIP-9" href="#Footnote_IIP-9" class="fnanchor">[II'-9]</a> as a deputy surveyor on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">657</a></span>
Florida line between the United States and Spain, in the
years 1797 and '98. General Salcedo then desired him to
assist me in taking out my papers, and requested me to explain
the nature of each; such as he conceived were relevant
to the expedition he caused to be laid on one side, and those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">658</a></span>
which were not of a public nature on the other; the whole
either passing through the hands of the general or of
Walker, except a few letters from my lady. On my taking
these up, and saying they were letters from a lady, the general
gave a proof that, if the ancient Spanish bravery had
degenerated in the nation generally, their gallantry still existed,
by bowing; and I put them in my pocket. He then
informed me that he would examine the papers, but that in
the meanwhile he wished me to make out and present to him
a short sketch of my voyage,<a name="FNanchor_IIP-10" id="FNanchor_IIP-10" href="#Footnote_IIP-10" class="fnanchor">[II'-10]</a> which might probably be satisfactory.
This I would have positively refused, had I had
an idea that it was his determination to keep the papers,
which I could not at that time conceive, from the urbanity
and satisfaction which he appeared to exhibit on the event
of our interview. He then told me that I would take up my
quarters with Walker, in order, as he said, to be better
accommodated by having a person with me who spoke the
English language; but the object, as I suspected, was for
him to be a spy on our actions and on those who visited us.</p>

<p>Robinson all this time had been standing in the guardroom,
boiling with indignation at being so long detained
there, subject to the observations of the soldiery and gaping
curiosity of the vulgar. He was now introduced, by
some mistake of one of the aides-de-camp. He appeared
and made a slight bow to the general, who demanded of
Malgares who he [Robinson] was. He replied, "A doctor
who accompanied the expedition." "Let him retire," said
the governor; and he went out.</p>

<p>The general then invited me to return and dine with him,
and we went to the quarters of Walker, where we received
several different invitations to take quarters at houses where
we might be better accommodated; but, understanding that
the general had designated our quarters, we were silent.</p>

<p>We returned to dine at the palace, where we met Malgares,
who, besides ourselves, was the only guest. He had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">659</a></span>
at the table the treasurer, Truxillio [qu.: Trujillo?], and a
priest called Father Rocus.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 3d.</i> Employed in giving a sketch of our voyage for
the general and commandant of those provinces. Introduced
to Don Bernardo Villamil; Don Alberto Mayner,
lieutenant-colonel, and father-in-law to Malgares; and Don
Manuel Zuloaga, a member of the secretary's office, to
whom I am under obligations of gratitude, and shall remember
with esteem. Visited his house in the evening.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 4th.</i> Visited the hospital, where were two officers,
who were fine-looking men, and I was informed had been
the gayest young men of the province. They were moldering
away by disease, and there was not a physician in his
Majesty's hospitals who was able to cure them; but after
repeated attempts, all had given them up to perish. This
shows the deplorable state of medical science in the provinces.
I endeavored to get Robinson to undertake the
cure of these poor fellows, but the jealousy and envy of
the Spanish doctors made it impracticable.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Apr. 5th.</i> Visited by Lieutenant Malgares, with
a very polite message from his Excellency, delivered in the
most impressive terms, with offers of assistance, money, etc.,
for which I returned my respectful thanks to the general.
Accompanied Malgares to the public walk, where we
found the secretary, Captain Villamil, Zuloaga, and other
officers of distinction. We here likewise met the wife of my
friend Malgares, to whom he introduced us. She was, like
all the other ladies of New Spain, a little <i>en bon point</i>, but
possessed the national beauty of eye in a superior degree.
There was a large collection of ladies, amongst whom were
two of the most celebrated in the capital&mdash;Señora Maria
Con. Caberairi, and Señora Margeurite Vallois, the only two
ladies who had spirit sufficient, and their husbands generosity
enough, to allow them to think themselves rational
beings, to be treated on an equality, to receive the visits of
their friends, and give way to the hospitality of their dispositions
without restraint. They were consequently the envy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">660</a></span>
of other ladies, and the subject of scandal to prudes; their
houses were the rendezvous of all the fashionable male society;
and every man who was conspicuous for science, arts,
or arms, was sure to meet a welcome. We, as unfortunate
strangers, were consequently not forgotten. I returned with
Malgares to the house of his father-in-law, Lieutenant-Colonel
Mayner, who was originally from Cadiz, a man of
good information.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 6th.</i> Dined with the general. Writing, etc. In the
evening visited Malgares and the secretary. After dinner
wine was set on the table, and we were entertained with
songs in the French, Italian, Spanish, and English languages.
Accustomed as I was to sitting some time after
dinner I forgot their <i>siesta</i>, or repose after dinner, until
Walker suggested the thing to me, when we retired.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 7th.</i> Dined at Don Antonio Caberairi's, [qu.: Cabrera's?]
in company with Villamil, Zuloaga, Walker, etc.
Sent in the sketch of my voyage to the general. Spent the
evening at Colonel Mayner's with Malgares.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 8th.</i> Visited the treasurer, who showed me the
double-barreled gun given by Governor [Wm. C. C.] Claiborne,
and another formerly the property of [Captain Philip]
Nolan [see <a href="#Footnote_IIP-9">note<sup>9</sup>, p. 657</a>, and legend on Pike's map].</p>

<p><i>Apr. 9th.</i> In the evening I was informed that David
Ferro<a name="FNanchor_IIP-11" id="FNanchor_IIP-11" href="#Footnote_IIP-11" class="fnanchor">[II'-11]</a> was in town and wished to speak to me. This man
had formerly been my father's ensign, and was taken with
Nolan's party at the time the latter was killed. He possessed
a brave soul, and had withstood every oppression,
since being made prisoner, with astonishing fortitude.
Although his leaving the place of his confinement, the village
of St. Jeronimie [San Jeronimo], without the knowledge
of the general, was in some measure clandestine, yet a countryman,
an acquaintance, and formerly a brother soldier, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">661</a></span>
a strange land, in distress, had ventured much to see me&mdash;could
I deny him the interview from any motives of delicacy?
No; forbid it, humanity! forbid it, every sentiment
of my soul!</p>

<p>Our meeting was affecting, tears standing in his eyes. He
informed me of the particulars of their being taken, and
many other circumstances since they had been in the
country. I promised to do all I could for him consistently
with my character and honor, and their having entered the
country without the authority of the United States. As he
was obliged to leave town before day, he called on me at my
quarters, when I bid him adieu, and gave him what my
purse afforded, not what my heart dictated.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 10th.</i> In the evening at Colonel Maynor's. Captain
Rodiriques [Rodriguez] arrived from the province of
Texas, where he had been under arrest one year, for going
to Natchitoches with the Marquis Cassa Calvo [Marques de
Casa Calva].</p>

<p><i>Apr. 11th.</i> Rode out in the coach with Malgares; was
hospitably entertained at the house of one of the Vallois,
where we drank London porter. Visited Secretary Villamil.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Apr. 12th.</i> Dined with the doctor, at Don Antonio
Caberarie's, with our usual guests. In the evening at
the public walks.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 13th.</i> Nothing extraordinary.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 14th.</i> Spent the forenoon in writing; the afternoon
at Don Antonio Caberarie's.</p>

<p><i>Apr.15th.</i> Spent the evening at Colonel Maynor's [qu.:
Mayron's?] with our friend Malgares. Wrote a letter to
Governor Salcedo on the subject of my papers.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-12" id="FNanchor_IIP-12" href="#Footnote_IIP-12" class="fnanchor">[II'-12]</a></p>

<p><i>Apr. 16th.</i> Spent the evening at the secretary's, Don
Villamil's.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 17th.</i> Sent my letter to his Excellency. Spent the
evening with my friend Malgares.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">662</a></span></p>

<p><i>Apr. 18th.</i> Spent the evening at Caberarie's, etc. Wrote
to Governor Allencaster.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Apr. 19th.</i> In the evening at a fandango.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 20th.</i> We this day learned that an American officer
had gone on to the city of Mexico. This was an enigma to
us inexplicable, as we conceived that the jealousy of the
Spanish government would have prevented any foreign
officer from penetrating the country; and why the United
States could send an authorized agent to the viceroyalty,
when the Spanish government had at the seat of our government
a chargé d'affaires, served but to darken the conjectures.
The person alluded to was Mr. Burling, a citizen
of Mississippi Territory, whose mission is now well known
to the government. We likewise received an account of a
commercial treaty having been entered into between Great
Britain and the United States, which by the Dons was only
considered as the preliminary step to an alliance offensive
and defensive between the two nations.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 21st.</i> Presented the commanding general with a
letter for General Wilkinson, which he promised to have
forwarded to the governor of Texas.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 22d.</i> Spent the day in reading and studying Spanish;
the evening at Captain Villamil's.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 23d.</i> Dined at Don Pedro Vallois'; spent the evening
with Colonel Maynor; bade him adieu, as he was to
march the next day. In the evening received a letter from
the commandant-general, informing me my papers were to be
detained, giving a certificate of their numbers, contents, etc.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-13" id="FNanchor_IIP-13" href="#Footnote_IIP-13" class="fnanchor">[II'-13]</a></p>

<p><i>Apr. 24th.</i> Spent the evening at Zuloaga's with his relations.
About sundown an officer of the government called
upon me, and told me that the government had been
informed that, in conversations in all societies, Robinson
and myself had held forth political maxims and principles
which, if just, I must be conscious if generally disseminated
would in a very few years be the occasion of a revolt of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">663</a></span>
those kingdoms; that those impressions had taken such
effect that it was no uncommon thing, in the circles in
which he associated, to hear the comparative principles of
a republican and a monarchical government discussed, and
even the allegiance due, in case of certain events, to the
court called in question; that various characters of consideration
had indulged themselves in those conversations, all
of whom were noted and would be taken care of; but that,
as respected myself and companion, it was the desire of his
Excellency that while in the dominions of Spain we would
not hold forth any conversations whatsoever, either on the
subject of religion or politics.</p>

<p>I replied that it was true I had held various and free
conversations on the subjects complained of, but only with
men high in office, who might be supposed to be firmly
attached to the king, and partial to the government of their
country; that I had never gone among the poor and illiterate,
preaching up republicanism or a free government;
that as to the catholic religion, I had only combated some
of what I conceived to be its illiberal dogmas; that I had
spoken of it in all instances as a respectable branch of the
Christian religion which, as well as all others, was tolerated
in the United States; and that, had I come to that kingdom
in a diplomatic character, delicacy toward the government
would have sealed my lips; or had I been a prisoner
of war, personal safety might have had the same effect;
but, being there in the capacity which I was, not voluntarily,
but by coercion of the Spanish government, which at
the same time had officially notified me that they did not
consider me under any restraint whatever; therefore, when
called on, I should always give my opinions freely, either as
to politics or religion; but at the same time with urbanity,
and a proper respect to the legitimate authorities of the
country where I was.</p>

<p>He replied, "Well, you may then rest assured your conduct
will be represented in no very favorable point of view
to your government."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">664</a></span></p>

<p>I replied, "To my government I am certainly responsible,
and to no other."</p>

<p>He then left me. I immediately waited on some of my
friends and notified them of the threat, at which they appeared
much alarmed. We went immediately to consult
[Malgares], who, to great attachment to his friends, joined
the most incorruptible loyalty and the confidence of the
government. Our consultation ended in a determination
only to be silent and watch events.</p>

<p>We suspected [Walker] to be the informant, but whether
just in our suspicion or not, I will not pretend to determine;
for Robinson and myself frequently used to hold
conversations in his presence, purposely to have them communicated;
but he at last discovered our intentions, and
told us that if we calculated on making him a carrier of
news, we were mistaken; that he despised it.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 25th.</i> At eleven o'clock I called on his Excellency,
but was informed that he was engaged. About three
o'clock I received a message from him by Lieutenant
Walker, informing me that he was surprised I had not
returned, and to call without ceremony in the evening;
which I did, and presented him with a letter.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-14" id="FNanchor_IIP-14" href="#Footnote_IIP-14" class="fnanchor">[II'-14]</a> He then
also candidly informed me my party would not join me in
the territory of the king of Spain, but that they should be
attended to punctually, and forwarded on immediately after
me; and requested that I should give orders to my sergeant
to deliver up all his ammunition, and dispose in some
manner of the horses of which he had charge. I stated
in reply that, with respect to the ammunition, I would
give orders to my sergeant to deliver, if demanded, all they
possessed, more than was necessary to fill their horns; but
that as to the horses, I considered their loss was a charge
which must be adjusted between the two governments, and
therefore should not give any directions respecting them,
except as to bringing them on as far and as long as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">665</a></span>
were able to travel. He then gave me an invitation to
dine with him on the morrow.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Apr. 26th.</i> Dined at the general's. In the
evening went to Malgares', Zuloaga's, and others'. Wrote
to my sergeant and Fero; to the latter of whom I sent $10,
and to the other $161.84, to purchase clothes for the party.
We had been for some time suspicious that the doctor was
to be detained; but this evening he likewise obtained permission
to pursue his journey with me, which diffused
general joy through all the party.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 27th.</i> Spent the day in making arrangements for
our departure, writing to the sergeant, etc.</p>

<p>I will here mention some few anecdotes relative to
[Walker], with whom we boarded during our stay in
Chihuahua. When we came to the city we went to his
quarters, by order of the general, and considered ourselves
as guests, having not the least idea that we should be
charged with board, knowing with what pleasure any
American officer would receive and entertain a foreign
brother soldier situated as we were, and that we should
conceive it a great insult to be offered pay under similar
circumstances. But one day, after we had been there about
a week, he presented to me an account for Robinson's and
my board, receipted, and begged, if the general inquired of
me, that I would say I had paid it. This naturally led me to
demand how the thing originated. He with considerable embarrassment
observed that he had taken the liberty to remark
to the general that he thought he should be allowed an extra
allowance, in order to be enabled to treat us with some little
distinction. The general flew into a violent passion, and
demanded if I had not paid him for our board? To which
the other replied, No, he did not expect pay of us. He
ordered him immediately to demand pay, to receive it, sign
a receipt, and lodge it in his hands; and added that he
would consult me if [to ascertain whether] the thing was
done. This he never did; yet I took care, every Sunday
after that, to deposit in the hands of Walker a sum which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">666</a></span>
was considered the proportion for Robinson and myself.
Malgares and several others of the Spanish officers having
heard of the thing, waited on us much mortified, saying
with what pleasure they would have entertained us had not
the designation of the general pointed out his will on the
subject.</p>

<p>[Walker] had living with him an old negro, the only one
I saw on that side of St. Antonio, who was the property of
some person who resided near Natchez, and who had been
taken with Nolan. Having been acquainted with him in
the Mississippi country, he solicited and obtained permission
for old Cæsar to live with him. I found him very communicative
and extremely useful. The day I arrived, when
we were left alone, he came in, looked around at the walls
of the room, and exclaimed, "What! all gone?" I demanded
an explanation, and he informed me that the maps
of the different provinces, as taken by [Walker] and other
surveyors, had been hung up against the walls; but that the
day we arrived they had all been taken down and deposited
in a closet which he designated.</p>

<p>W[alker] gave various reasons for having left the United
States and joined the Spanish service; one of which was,
his father having been ill-treated, as he conceived, by G.
at Natchez. At Chihuahua he had charge of the military
school, which consisted of about 15 young men of the first
families of the provinces; also of the public water-works of
the city, on a plan devised by the royal engineer of Mexico;
of the building of a new church; of the casting of small
artillery, fabrication of arms, etc. Thus, though he had
tendered his resignation, they knew his value too well to
part with him, and would not accept of it, but still kept
him in a subordinate station, in order that he might be the
more dependent and the more useful. Although he candidly
confessed his disgust at their service, manners, morals, and
political establishments, yet he never made a communication
to us which he was bound in honor to conceal; but on
the contrary fulfilled the station of informer, which in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">667</a></span>
country is considered no disgrace, with great punctuality
and fidelity. In this city the proverb was literally true,
that "the walls have ears"; for scarcely anything could
pass that his Excellency did not know in a few hours.</p>

<p>In the evening I was notified to be ready to march the
next day at three o'clock.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 28th.</i> In the morning Malgares waited on us, and
informed us he was to accompany us some distance on the
route. After bidding adieu to all our friends, we marched
at a quarter past three o'clock, and encamped at nine
o'clock at a stony spring; passed near Chihuahua a small
ridge of mountains, and then encamped in a hollow.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-15" id="FNanchor_IIP-15" href="#Footnote_IIP-15" class="fnanchor">[II'-15]</a></p>

<p>As we were riding along, Malgares rode up to me and
informed me that the general had given orders that I
should not be permitted to make any astronomical observations.
To this I replied that he well knew I never had
attempted making any since I had been conducted into
the Spanish dominions.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 29th.</i> Arrived at a settlement [Horcasitas or Bachimba?]
at eight o'clock; plenty of milk, etc.</p>

<p>When about to make my journal, Malgares changed
color, and informed me it was his orders I should not take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">668</a></span>
notes; but added, "you have a good memory, and when
you get to Cogquilla [Coahuila] you can bring it all up."
At first I felt considerably indignant, and was on the point
of refusing to comply; but thinking for a moment of the
many politenesses I had received from his hands induced
me merely to bow assent with a smile. We proceeded on
our route, but had not gone far before I made a pretext to
halt, established my boy as a vedet [vidette], sat down
peaceably under a bush, and made my notes. This course
I pursued ever after, not without some very considerable
degree of trouble to separate myself from the party.</p>

<p>Arrived at the fort of St. Paul at eleven o'clock, situated
on a small river of the same name, the course of which is
N. E. by S. W. At the time we were there the river was
not wider than a mill stream; but sometimes it is 300 yards
wide, and impassable. Distance 30 miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-16" id="FNanchor_IIP-16" href="#Footnote_IIP-16" class="fnanchor">[II'-16]</a></p>

<p><i>Apr. 30th.</i> Marched at six o'clock, and at eleven arrived
at [Saucillo, on] the river Conchos&mdash;24 miles; beautiful
green trees on its banks. I was taken very sick at half past
ten o'clock. Arrived at night at a small station [Las Garzas]
on the river Conchos, garrisoned by a sergeant and 10 men
from Fort Conchos, 15 leagues up said river. Distance 43
miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-17" id="FNanchor_IIP-17" href="#Footnote_IIP-17" class="fnanchor">[II'-17]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">669</a></span></p>

<p><i>May 1st.</i> Marched up the Conchos to its confluence with
the river Florada [Rio Florido], 15 leagues from where we
left the former [Conchos] river, and took up the latter [Rio
Florido], which bears from the Conchos S. 80° and 50° E.
On its banks are some very flourishing settlements, and they
are well timbered. A poor miserable village [Santa Rosalia]
is at the confluence. Came 10 miles up the Florada to dinner,
and at night stopped at a private house. This property
or plantation was valued formerly at $300,000, extending on
the Florada, from the small place where we slept on the
30th of April, 30 leagues up said river. Distance 45 miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-18" id="FNanchor_IIP-18" href="#Footnote_IIP-18" class="fnanchor">[II'-18]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">670</a></span></p>

<p>Finding that a new species of discipline had taken place,
and that the suspicions of my friend Malgares were much
more acute than ever, I conceived it necessary to take some
steps to secure the notes I had taken, which had been clandestinely
acquired. In the night I arose, and after making
my men charge all their pieces well, I took my small books
and rolled them up in small rolls, tore a fine shirt to pieces,
and wrapped it round the papers, and put them down in the
barrels of the guns, until we just left room for the tompoins
[tampons], which were then carefully put in; the remainder
we secured about our bodies under our shirts. This occupied
about two hours, but was effected without discovery
and without suspicions.</p>

<p><i>May 2d.</i> Marched early, and in 4¼ hours arrived at
Guaxequillo,<a name="FNanchor_IIP-19" id="FNanchor_IIP-19" href="#Footnote_IIP-19" class="fnanchor">[II'-19]</a> situated on the river Florada, where we were
to exchange our friend Malgares for Captain Barelo, who
was a Mexican by birth, born near the capital and entered as
a cadet at Guaxequillo near 20 years past, and who, by his
extraordinary merits, being a Creolian, had been promoted
to a captaincy, which was even by himself considered his
ultimate promotion. He was a gentleman in his manners,
generous and frank, and I believe a good soldier.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, May 3d.</i> At Guaxequillo the captain gave up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">671</a></span>
his command to Malgares. At night the officers gave a ball,
at which appeared at least sixty women, ten or a dozen of
whom were very handsome.</p>

<p><i>May 4th.</i> Don Hymen Guloo arrived from Chihuahua,
accompanied by a citizen and a friar, who had been arrested
by order of the commandant-general, and was on his way to
Mexico for trial.</p>

<p><i>May 5th.</i> The party marched with all the spare horses
and baggage.</p>

<p><i>May 6th.</i> Marched at five o'clock; ascended the river
four miles, when we left it to our right and took off S. 60°
E., eight miles. Our friend Malgares accompanied us a few
miles, to whom we bade an eternal adieu, if war does not
bring us together in the field of battle opposed as the most
deadly enemies, when our hearts acknowledge the greatest
friendship. Halted at ten o'clock, and marched again at four.
No water on the road; detached a Spanish soldier in search
of some, who did not join us until twelve o'clock at night.
Encamped in the open prairie; no wood; no water, except
what the soldier brought us in gourds. The mules
came up at eleven o'clock at night. Distance 30 miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-20" id="FNanchor_IIP-20" href="#Footnote_IIP-20" class="fnanchor">[II'-20]</a></p>

<p><i>May 7th.</i> Marched very early; wind fresh from the
south. The punctuality of Captain Barelo as to hours was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">672</a></span>
remarkable. Arrived at half past nine o'clock at a spring
[Ojo S. Bernarde of Pike's map?], the first water from
Guaxequillo. The mules did not unload, but continued on
nine miles to another spring [Ojo S Blas of Pike's map] at
the foot of a mountain, with good pasturage round it;
mountains on each side all day.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-21" id="FNanchor_IIP-21" href="#Footnote_IIP-21" class="fnanchor">[II'-21]</a></p>

<p><i>May 8th.</i> Marched, at five miles due west, through a gap
in the mountains; then turned S. 20° E., and more south to
a [Cerro Gordo or Andabazo] river about 20 feet wide, with
high steep banks; now dry except in holes, but sometimes
full and impassable. Halted at seven o'clock and sent on
the loaded mules. Marched at five o'clock; came ten miles
and encamped without water. Distance 18 miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-22" id="FNanchor_IIP-22" href="#Footnote_IIP-22" class="fnanchor">[II'-22]</a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">673</a></span></p>

<p><i>May 9th.</i> Marched between four and five o'clock and
arrived at Pelia [Pelayo] at eight.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-23" id="FNanchor_IIP-23" href="#Footnote_IIP-23" class="fnanchor">[II'-23]</a> This is only a station
for a few soldiers, but is surrounded by [copper] mines.
At this place are two large warm springs, strongly impregnated
with sulphur, and this is the water obliged to be used
by the party who are stationed there. Here we remained
all day. Captain Barelo had two beeves killed for his and
my men, and charged nothing to either. Here he received
orders from the general to lead us through the wilderness
to Montelovez [Monclova], in order that we should not
approximate to the frontiers of Mexico, which we should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">674</a></span>
have done by the usual route of Pattos [Patos], Paras
[Parras], etc.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, May 10th.</i> Marched past one copper mine
[Oruilla], now diligently worked. At this place the proprietor
had 100,000 sheep, cattle, horses, etc. Arrived at
the Cadena,<a name="FNanchor_IIP-24" id="FNanchor_IIP-24" href="#Footnote_IIP-24" class="fnanchor">[II'-24]</a> a house built and occupied by a priest. It is
situated on a small stream at the pass of the [Sierra de las
Mimbres] mountains, called by the Spaniards [Puerta de
Cadena, or] Door of the Prison, from its being surrounded
with mountains. The proprietor was at Sumbraretto [Sombrerito],
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">675</a></span>
distance six days' march. This hacienda was
obliged to furnish accommodations to all travelers.</p>

<p>Marched at five o'clock, passed the chain of mountains
due east [in the direction of Mapimi] 12 miles, and encamped
without water. Distance 31 miles.</p>

<p><i>May 11th.</i> Marched and arrived at Maupemie [Mapimi<a name="FNanchor_IIP-25" id="FNanchor_IIP-25" href="#Footnote_IIP-25" class="fnanchor">[II'-25]</a>]
at eight o'clock, a village situated at the foot of mountains
of minerals, where they worked eight or nine mines. The
mass of the people were naked and starved wretches. The
proprietor of the mines gave us an elegant repast. Here
the orders of Salcedo were explained to me by the captain.
I replied that they excited my laughter, as there were disaffected
persons sufficient to serve as guides should an army
ever come into the country.</p>

<p>Came on three miles further, where were fig-trees and
a fruit called by the French La Grain [<i>sic</i>], situated on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">676</a></span>
a little stream which flowed through the gardens, and
formed a terrestrial paradise. Here we remained all day
sleeping in the shade of the fig-trees, and at night continued
our residence in the garden. We obliged the inhabitants
with a ball, who expressed great anxiety for a relief from
their present distressed state, and a change of government.</p>

<p><i>May 12th.</i> Was awakened in the morning by the singing
of the birds and the perfume of the trees around. I attempted
to send two of my soldiers to town [Mapimi],
but they were overtaken by a dragoon and ordered back;
on their return I again ordered them to go, and told them
if a soldier attempted to stop them to take him off his horse
and flog him. This I did, as I conceived it was the duty of
the captain to explain his orders relative to me, which he
had not done; and I conceived that this would bring on an
explanation. They were pursued by a dragoon through the
town, who rode after them, making use of ill language.
They attempted to catch him, but could not. As I had
mentioned my intention of sending my men to town after
some stores to Captain Barelo, and he had not made any
objections, I conceived it was acting with duplicity to send
men to watch the movements of my messengers. I therefore
determined they should punish the dragoons unless
the captain had candor sufficient to explain his reasons
for not wishing my men to go to town, in which wish I
should undoubtedly have acquiesced; but as he never
mentioned the circumstance, I was guardedly silent, and
the affair never interrupted our harmony.</p>

<p>We marched at five o'clock; came on 15 miles and encamped
without water. One mile on this side of the little
village<a name="FNanchor_IIP-26" id="FNanchor_IIP-26" href="#Footnote_IIP-26" class="fnanchor">[II'-26]</a> the road branches out into three. The right-hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">677</a></span>
one by Pattos, Paras, Saltelo [Patos, Parras, Saltillo], etc.,
is the main road to [the city of] Mexico and San Antonio
[in Texas]. The [middle] road which we took leaves all the
villages a little to the right, passing only some plantations.
The left-hand one goes immediately through the mountains
to Montelovez, but is dangerous for small parties on account
of the savages; this road is called the route by the Bolson
of Maupeme, and was first traveled by Monsieur de Croix,
afterward viceroy of Peru. In passing from Chihuahua to
Texas, by this [left-hand] route, you make in seven days
what it takes you 15 or 20 by the ordinary one; but it is
very scarce of water, and your guards must either be so
strong as to defy the Appaches, or calculate to escape them
by swiftness; for they fill those mountains, whence they
continually carry on a predatory war against the Spanish
settlements and caravans.</p>

<p>We this day passed on to the territories of the Marquis
de San Miquel [Miguel], who owns from the mountains of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">678</a></span>
the Rio del Norte to some distance in the kingdom of Old
Mexico.</p>

<p><i>May 13th.</i> Came on to the river Brasses [Rio Nasas,<a name="FNanchor_IIP-27" id="FNanchor_IIP-27" href="#Footnote_IIP-27" class="fnanchor">[II'-27]</a>
on which was the] Ranche de St. Antonio, part of the
marquis' estate. My boy and self halted at the river
Brasses to water our horses, having ridden on ahead, and
took the bridles from their mouths in order that they might
drink freely, which they could not do with the Spanish
bridles. The horse I rode had been accustomed to being
held by his master in a peculiar manner when bridled, and
would not let me put it on again for a long time; in the
meantime my boy's horse ran away, and it was out of our
power to catch him again. But when we arrived at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">679</a></span>
Ranche,<a name="FNanchor_IIP-28" id="FNanchor_IIP-28" href="#Footnote_IIP-28" class="fnanchor">[II'-28]</a> we soon had out a number of boys, who brought
in the horse and all his different equipments, which were
scattered on the route. This certainly was a strong proof
of their honesty, and did not go unrewarded. In the
evening we gave them a ball on the green, according to
custom. We here learned that one peck of corn, with
three pounds of meat per week, was the allowance given a
grown person.</p>

<p><i>May 14th.</i> Did not march until half past four o'clock
[p. m.]. About nine o'clock [a. m.] an officer arrived from
St. Rosa<a name="FNanchor_IIP-29" id="FNanchor_IIP-29" href="#Footnote_IIP-29" class="fnanchor">[II'-29]</a> with 24 men, with two Appaches in irons. They
were noble-looking fellows, of large stature, and appeared
by no means cast down by their misfortunes, although they
knew their fate was transportation beyond the sea, never
more to see their friends and relations.</p>

<p>Knowing as I did the intention of the Spaniards toward
those people, I would have liberated them if in my power.
I went near them, gave them to understand we were friends,
and conveyed to them some articles which would be of
service if chance offered.</p>

<p>This day the thermometer stood at 30° Raumauer
[Réaumur], 99½° Fahrenheit. The dust and drought of
the road obliged us to march in the night, when we came
15 miles and encamped without water. Indeed, this road
which the general obliged us to take is almost impassable
at this season for want of water, whilst the other is plentifully
supplied.</p>

<p><i>May 15th.</i> Marched early and came on five miles, when
we arrived at a pit dug in a hollow, which afforded a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">680</a></span>
quantity of water for ourselves and beasts.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-30" id="FNanchor_IIP-30" href="#Footnote_IIP-30" class="fnanchor">[II'-30]</a> Here we were
obliged to remain all day in order to travel in the night, as
our beasts could enjoy the benefit of water. Left at half
past five o'clock and came on 15 miles by eleven o'clock,
when we encamped without water or food for our beasts.
Passed a miserable burnt-up soil. Distance 20 miles.</p>

<p><i>May 16th.</i> Marched two miles and arrived at a wretched
habitation [El Pozo?], where we drew water from a well for
all the beasts. Marched in the evening and made 15 miles
further [<i>sic</i>]. The right-hand road we left on this side of
Maupeme [Mapimi], and joined it about four miles further.
Distance 15 [<i>sic</i>] miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-31" id="FNanchor_IIP-31" href="#Footnote_IIP-31" class="fnanchor">[II'-31]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">681</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sunday, May 17th.</i> Marched; about seven o'clock came
in sight of Paras [Parras], which we left on the right and
halted at the Hacienda of St. Lorenzo, a short league to the
north of said village.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-32" id="FNanchor_IIP-32" href="#Footnote_IIP-32" class="fnanchor">[II'-32]</a> At the Hacienda of St. Lorenzo was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">682</a></span>
a young priest, who was extremely anxious for a change of
government, and came to our beds and conversed for hours
on the subject.</p>

<p><i>May 18th.</i> Marched early and came through a mountainous
tract of country, well watered, with houses situated here
and there amongst the rocks. Joined the main road at a
Hacienda of [Cienega Grande], belonging to the Marquis
de San Miquel [Miguel]; good gardens and fruit; also a
fine stream.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-33" id="FNanchor_IIP-33" href="#Footnote_IIP-33" class="fnanchor">[II'-33]</a> The mules did not arrive until late at night,
when it had commenced raining.</p>

<p><i>May 19th.</i> Did not march until three o'clock, the captain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">683</a></span>
not being very well. He here determined to take the main
road, notwithstanding the orders of General Salcedo. Came
on 10 miles [vicinity of Rancho Nuevo and Castañuela<a name="FNanchor_IIP-34" id="FNanchor_IIP-34" href="#Footnote_IIP-34" class="fnanchor">[II'-34]</a>].
Met a deserter from Captain [Francis] Johnston's company
[then probably of the 2d Infantry]. He returned, came to
camp, and begged me to take him back to his company;
but I would not give any encouragement to the scoundrel&mdash;only
a little change, as he was without a farthing.</p>

<p><i>May 20th.</i> Came to the Hacienda of Pattos [Patos] by
nine o'clock. This is a handsome place, where the Marquis
De San Miquel [Miguel] frequently spends his summers, the
distance enabling him to come from [the City of] Mexico in
his coach in 10 days. Here we met the Mexican post-rider
going to Chewawa [Chihuahua]. Don Hymie [Hymen],
who had left us at Paras [Parras], joined in a coach and six,
in which we came out to a little settlement called the
Florida, one league from Pattos, due north. Distance 18
miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-35" id="FNanchor_IIP-35" href="#Footnote_IIP-35" class="fnanchor">[II'-35]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">684</a></span></p>

<p>The Hacienda of Pattos was a square inclosure of about
300 feet, the building being one story high, but some of the
apartments were elegantly furnished. In the center of the
square was a jet d'eau, which cast forth water from eight
spouts, extended from a colossean female form. From this
fountain all the neighboring inhabitants got their supply of
water. The marquis had likewise a very handsome church,
which, with its ornaments, cost him at least $20,000; to officiate
in which, he maintained a little stiff superstitious priest.
In the rear of the palace, for so it might be called, was a
fish-pond, in which were immense numbers of fine fish. The
population of Florida is about 2,000 souls. This was our
nearest point to the city of Mexico.</p>

<p><i>May 21st.</i> Marched down the [San Antonio] water-course
over a rough and stony road about 10 miles, when we left it
on the right [crossed it from E. to W.], and came on eight
miles further to a horse-range of the marquis', where he had
four of his soldiers as a guarda caballo [herders]. Halted
at half past nine o'clock.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-36" id="FNanchor_IIP-36" href="#Footnote_IIP-36" class="fnanchor">[II'-36]</a> At this place we had a spring
of bad water.</p>

<p><i>May 22d.</i> Marched [north] at three o'clock; came on
16 miles to a small shed, and in the afternoon to la Rancho,
eight miles to the left of the main road, near the foot of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">685</a></span>
the mountain, where was a pond of water, but no houses.
Some Spanish soldiers were here. We left Pattos mountain
on our left and right, but here there was a cross mountain
[El Monte de los Tres Rios] over which we were to pass in
the morning.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-37" id="FNanchor_IIP-37" href="#Footnote_IIP-37" class="fnanchor">[II'-37]</a></p>

<p>The marquis maintains 1,500 troops to protect his vassals
and property from the savages. They are all cavalry, as
well dressed and armed as the king's, but are treated by
the king's troops as if vastly inferior.</p>

<p><i>May 23d.</i> Marched early and came to a spring in the
mountain.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-38" id="FNanchor_IIP-38" href="#Footnote_IIP-38" class="fnanchor">[II'-38]</a></p>

<p><i>Sunday, May 24th.</i> Marched at an early hour and passed
through [El Paso de los Tres Rios in] the mountains, where
there was scarcely any road, called the Mountain of the Three
Rivers. At the 13th mile joined the main road, which we
had left to our right on the 22d instant, and in one hour
after came to the main Mexican road from the eastern
provinces; thence northwest to the Rancho, nine miles
from Montelovez, whence the captain sent in an express to
give notice of our approach.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-39" id="FNanchor_IIP-39" href="#Footnote_IIP-39" class="fnanchor">[II'-39]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">686</a></span></p>

<p><i>May 25th.</i> In the afternoon Lieutenant Adams, commandant
of the company of Montelovez, arrived in a coach
and six to escort us to town, where we arrived about
five o'clock. In the evening visited Captain de Ferara
[qu.: Don Juan Joaquin de Ferrero?], commandant of the
troops of Cogquilla, and inspector of the five provinces.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Adams, who commanded this place, was the
son of an Irish engineer in the service of Spain. He had
married a rich girl of the Passo del Norte, and they lived
here in elegance and style, for the country. We put up at
his quarters and were very hospitably entertained.</p>

<p><i>May 26th.</i> Made preparations for marching the next
day. I arose early, before any of our people were up, and
walked nearly round the town; and from the hill took a
small survey, with my pencil and a pocket compass which I
always carried with me. Returned and found them at
breakfast, they having sent three or four of my men to
search for me. The Spanish troops at this place were
remarkably polite, always fronting and saluting when I
passed. This I attributed to their commandant, Lieutenant
Adams.</p>

<p><i>May 27th.</i> Marched at seven o'clock, after taking an
affectionate leave of Don Hymen, and at half past twelve
arrived at the Hacienda of Don Melcher [Michon on the
map], situated on the same stream of Montelovez.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-40" id="FNanchor_IIP-40" href="#Footnote_IIP-40" class="fnanchor">[II'-40]</a></p>

<p>Don Melcher was a man of very large fortune, polite,
generous, and friendly. He had in his service a man who
had deserted from Captain Lockwood's<a name="FNanchor_IIP-41" id="FNanchor_IIP-41" href="#Footnote_IIP-41" class="fnanchor">[II'-41]</a> company, first regiment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">687</a></span>
of infantry, by the name of Pratt. From this man he
had acquired a considerable quantity of crude indigested
information relative to the United States, and when he met
with us his thirst after knowledge of our laws and institutions
appeared to be insatiable. He caused a fine large
sheep to be killed and presented to my men.</p>

<p><i>May 28th.</i> Marched early and arrived at Encina Hacienda<a name="FNanchor_IIP-42" id="FNanchor_IIP-42" href="#Footnote_IIP-42" class="fnanchor">[II'-42]</a>
at ten o'clock. This place was owned by Don Barego
[Borages on the map].</p>

<p>When we arrived at the Hacienda of Encina, I found a
youth of 18 sitting in the house quite genteelly dressed,
whom I immediately recognized from his physiognomy to
be an American, and entered into conversation with him.
He expressed great satisfaction at meeting a countryman,
and we had a great deal of conversation. He sat at a table
with us and partook of a cold collation of fruits and confectionery;
but I was much surprised to learn, shortly after
we quit the table, that he was a deserter from our army;
on which I questioned him, and he replied that his name
was Griffith; he had enlisted in Philadelphia, arrived at
New Orleans, and deserted as soon as possible; the Spaniards
had treated him much better than his own countrymen,
and he should never return. I was extremely astonished at
his insolence, and mortified that I should have been betrayed
into any polite conduct toward the scoundrel. I told
him that it was astonishing he should have had the impertinence
to address himself to me, knowing that I was an
American officer. He muttered something about being in
a country where he was protected, etc.; on which I told
him that if he again opened his mouth to me, I would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">688</a></span>
instantly chastise him, notwithstanding his supposed protection.
He was silent; I called up one of my soldiers
and told him in his hearing, that if he attempted to mix
with them to turn him out of company; which they executed
by leading him to the door of their room a short
time after, when he entered it. When dinner was nearly
ready, I sent a message to the proprietor, that we assumed
no right to say whom he should introduce to his table, but
that we should think it a great indignity offered to a Spanish
officer to attempt to set him down at the same board
with a deserter from their army; and that if the man who
was at the table in the morning were to make his appearance
again, we should decline to eat at it. He replied that
it was an accident which had produced the event of the
morning; that he was sorry our feelings had been injured,
and that he would take care he [Griffith] did not appear
again whilst we were there.</p>

<p>Our good friend Don Melcher here overtook us, and
passed the evening with us.</p>

<p>This day we passed the last mountains, and again entered
the great Mississippi valley, it being six months and 13 days
since we first came in sight of them. Distance 20 miles.</p>

<p><i>May 29th.</i> Marched at seven o'clock and came to the
Millada river and a Rancho. [Distance 20 miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-43" id="FNanchor_IIP-43" href="#Footnote_IIP-43" class="fnanchor">[II'-43]</a>]</p>

<p><i>May 30th.</i> Marched at five o'clock and arrived at the
Sabine river at eight; forded it. Marched in the evening
at four o'clock, at ten encamped at the second ridge without
water. Distance 27 miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-44" id="FNanchor_IIP-44" href="#Footnote_IIP-44" class="fnanchor">[II'-44]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">689</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sunday, May 31st.</i> Marched early and at nine o'clock
arrived at a Rancho on fine running water; course east and
west. Marched eight miles further to a point of woods, and
encamped. No water. Distance 23 miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIP-45" id="FNanchor_IIP-45" href="#Footnote_IIP-45" class="fnanchor">[II'-45]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">
ITINERARY, CONCLUDED: THROUGH TEXAS TO NATCHITOCHES
ON THE RED RIVER OF LOUISIANA, JUNE 1ST-JULY
1ST, 1807.
</span></h2>

<p><i>Monday, June 1st.</i> Arrived at the Presidio Rio
Grande<a name="FNanchor_IIIP-1" id="FNanchor_IIIP-1" href="#Footnote_IIIP-1" class="fnanchor">[III'-1]</a> at eight o'clock. This place was the position
to which our friend Barelo had been ordered, and which had
been very highly spoken of to him; but he found himself
miserably mistaken, for it was with the greatest difficulty
we obtained anything to eat, which mortified him extremely.</p>

<p>When at Chihuahua, General Salcedo had asked me if
I had not lost a man by desertion, to which I replied in the
negative. He then informed me that an American had
arrived at the Presidio Rio Grande in the last year; that he
had at first confined him, but that he was now released and
practicing physic; and that he wished me to examine him
on my arrival. I therefore had him sent for; the moment
he entered the room I discovered he never had received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">691</a></span>
a liberal education, or been accustomed to polished society.
I told him the reason I had requested to see him, and that
I had it in my power to serve him if I found him a character
worthy of interference.</p>

<p>He then related the following story: That his name
was Martin Henderson; that he was born in Rock Bridge
County, State of Virginia; that he had been brought up
a farmer; but that, coming early to the State of Kentucky
and to Tennessee, he had acquired a taste for frontier life,
and that, in the spring of 1806, himself and four companions
had left the Saline in the District of Saint Genevieve, Upper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">692</a></span>
Louisiana, in order to penetrate through the woods to the
province of Texas; that his companions had left him on
the White [Arkansaw] river, and that he had continued on;
that in swimming some western branch his horse sunk
under him, and it was with difficulty he made the shore
with his gun. Here he waited two or three days until his
horse rose, and he then got his saddle-bags; but all his
notes on the country, courses, etc., were destroyed. He
then proceeded on foot for a few days, when he was met
by 30 or 40 Osage warriors, who, on his telling them he was
going to the Spaniards, were about to kill him; but on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">693</a></span>
saying he would go to the Americans, they held a consultation
over him, and finally seized on his clothes and divided
them between them; then his pistols, compass, dirk, and
watch, which they took to pieces and hung in their noses
and ears; then they stripped him naked, and round his
body found a belt with gold pieces sewed in it; this they
also took, and finally seized on his gun and ammunition,
and were marching off to leave him in that situation; but
he followed them, thinking it better to be killed than left
in that state to die by hunger and cold. The savages after
some time halted, and one pulled off an old pair of leggings
and gave him, another mockinsons, a third a buffalo robe,
and the one who had carried his heavy rifle had by this
time become tired of his prize, they never using rifles; they
counted him out 25 charges of powder and ball, then sent
two Indians with him, who put him on a war-trace, which
they said led to American establishments; and as soon as
the Indians left him he directed his course as he supposed
for Saint Antonio. He then killed deer and made himself
some clothes. He proceeded on and expended all his ammunition
three days before he struck the Grand Road,
nearly at the Rio Grande. He further added that he had
discovered two mines, one of silver and the other of gold,
the situation of which he particularly described; but that
the general had taken the samples from him. That he
would not attempt to pass himself on us for a physician,
and hoped, as he only used simples and was careful to do
no harm, we would not betray him. He further added that
since his being in the country he had made, from information,
maps of all the adjacent country; but that they had
been taken from him.</p>

<p>I had early concluded that he was an agent of Burr's, and
was revolving in my mind whether I should denounce him
as such to the commandant, but feeling reluctant from an
apprehension that he might be innocent, when one of my
men came in and informed me that it was Trainer, who had
killed Major Bashier [?] in the wilderness between Natchez
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">694</a></span>
and Tennessee, when he was his hireling. He shot him,
when taking a nap at noon, through the head with his own
pistols. The governor of the State and the major's friends
offered a very considerable reward for his apprehension,
which obliged him to quit the State; and with an Amazonian
woman, who handled arms and hunted like a savage,
he retreated to the source of the White river; but, being
routed from that retreat by Captain Maney [James B.
Many], of the United States army and a party of Cherokees,
he and his female companion bore west; she, proving
to be pregnant, was left by him in the desert, and I was
informed arrived at the settlements on Red river, but by
what means is to me unknown. The articles and money
taken from him by the Osages were the property of the
deceased major. I then reported these circumstances to
Captain Barelo, who had him immediately confined, until the
will of Governor Cordero should be known, who informed
me, when at Saint Antonio, that he would have him sent
to some place of perpetual confinement in the interior.
Thus vengeance has overtaken the ingrate and murderer
when he least expected it.</p>

<p>In the evening we went to see some performers on the
slack-rope, who were no wise extraordinary in their performances,
except in language which would bring a blush
on the cheek of the most abandoned of the female sex in
the United States.</p>

<p><i>June 2d.</i> In the day time were endeavoring to regulate
our watches by my compass, and in an instant that my
back was turned some person stole it. I could by no
means recover it, and I had strong suspicions that the theft
was approved, as the instrument had occasioned great
dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>This day the captain went out to dine with some monks,
who would have thought it profanation to have had us as
their guests, notwithstanding the priest of the place had
escorted us round the town and to all the missions; we
found him a very communicative, liberal, and intelligent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">695</a></span>
man. We saw no resource for a dinner but in the inventive
genius of a little Frenchman who had accompanied us
from Chihuahua, where he had been officiating one year as
cook to the general, of whom he gave us many interesting
anecdotes, and in fact was of infinite service to us; we supported
him and he served as cook, interpreter, etc. It was
astonishing with what zeal he strove to acquire news and
information for us; and as he had been four times through
the provinces, he had acquired considerable knowledge of
the country, people, etc. He went off and in a very short time
returned with table-cloth, plates, a dinner of three or four
courses, a bottle of wine, and a pretty girl to attend on the
table. We inquired by what magic he had brought this
about, and found that he had been to one of the officers
and notified him that it was the wish of the commandant
that he should supply the two Americans with a decent
dinner, which was done; but we took care to compensate
them for their trouble. This we explained to Barelo in the
evening, and he laughed heartily.</p>

<p>We parted from the captain with regrets and assurances
of remembrance. Departed at five o'clock, escorted by
Ensign [Blank] and [blank] men; came on to the Rio
Grande, which we passed, and encamped at a Rancho on
the other side. Distance seven miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIIP-2" id="FNanchor_IIIP-2" href="#Footnote_IIIP-2" class="fnanchor">[III'-2]</a></p>

<p><i>June 3d.</i> The mosquitoes, which had commenced the
first night on this side of Montelovez, now became very
troublesome. This day saw the first horse-flies; saw some
wild horses; came on in the open plain, and in a dry time,
when there was no water. Distance 30 miles.</p>

<p><i>June 4th.</i> Came 16 miles to a pond and dined; great
sign of wild horses; in the afternoon to the river Noissour
[Nueces], swimming where [<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, too deep to ford when] we
arrived, although it was not more than ten steps wide.
Distance 36 miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIIP-3" id="FNanchor_IIIP-3" href="#Footnote_IIIP-3" class="fnanchor">[III'-3]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">696</a></span></p>

<p><i>June 5th.</i> After losing two horses in passing the river,
the water having fallen so that we forded, we crossed and
continued our route. Passed two herds of wild horses,
which left the road for us. Halted at a pond on the left
of the road, 15 miles, where we saw the first oak since we
left New Mexico, and this was scrub oak. Passed many
deer yesterday and to-day. Came on to a small creek at
night, where we met a party of the company of Saint Fernandez
returning from the line. Distance 31 miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIIP-4" id="FNanchor_IIIP-4" href="#Footnote_IIIP-4" class="fnanchor">[III'-4]</a></p>

<p><i>June 6th.</i> Marched early and met several parties of
troops returning from Texas, where they had been sent to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">697</a></span>
re-enforce, when our troops were near the line. Immense
numbers of cross-roads made by the wild horses. Killed a
wild hog [peccary, <i>Dicotyles torquatus</i>], which on examination
I found to be very different from the tame breed,
smaller, brown, with long hair and short legs; they are to
be found in all parts between Red river and the Spanish
settlements.</p>

<p>Passed an encampment made by the Lee Panes [Lipans<a name="FNanchor_IIIP-5" id="FNanchor_IIIP-5" href="#Footnote_IIIP-5" class="fnanchor">[III'-5]</a>];
met one of said nation with his wife. In the afternoon
struck the woodland, which was the first we had been in
from the time we left the Osage nation. Distance 39 miles.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, June 7th.</i> Came on 15 miles to the [Medina] river
Mariano&mdash;the line between Texas and Cogquilla&mdash;a pretty
little stream, [on which was a] Rancho. Thence in the afternoon
to Saint Antonio.<a name="FNanchor_IIIP-6" id="FNanchor_IIIP-6" href="#Footnote_IIIP-6" class="fnanchor">[III'-6]</a> We halted at the mission of Saint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">698</a></span>
Joseph [San José]; received in a friendly manner by the
priest of the mission and others.</p>

<p>We were met out of Saint Antonio about three miles by
Governors Cordero and Herrara, in a coach. We repaired
to their quarters, where we were received like their children.
Cordero informed me that he had discretionary orders as to
the mode of my going out of the country; that he therefore
wished me to choose my time, mode, etc.; that any sum of
money I might want was at my service; that in the meantime
Robinson and myself would make his quarters our
home; and that he had caused to be vacated and prepared
a house immediately opposite for the reception of my men.
In the evening his levee was attended by a crowd of officers
and priests, among whom were Father M'Guire and Dr.
Zerbin. After supper we went to the public square, where
might be seen the two governors joined in a dance with
people who in the daytime would approach them with
reverence and awe.</p>

<p>We were here introduced to the sister of Lieutenant Malgares'
wife, who was one of the finest women we saw. She
was married to a Captain Ugarte, to whom we had letters
of introduction.</p>

<p><i>June 8th.</i> Remained at San Antonio.</p>

<p><i>June 9th.</i> A large party dined at Governor Cordero's, who
gave as his toast, "The President of the United States&mdash;Vive
la." I returned the compliment by toasting "His
Catholic Majesty." These toasts were followed by "General
Wilkinson." One of the company then gave "Those
gentlemen; their safe and happy arrival in their own country;
their honorable reception, and the continuation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">699</a></span>
the good understanding which exists between the two
countries."</p>

<p><i>June 10th.</i> A large party at the governor's to dinner. He
gave as a toast, "My companion, Herrara."</p>

<p><i>June 11th.</i> Preparing to march to-morrow. We this
evening had a conversation with the two governors,
wherein they exhibited an astonishing knowledge of the
political character of our Executive, and the local interests
of the different parts of the Union.</p>

<p><i>June 12th.</i> One of the captains from the kingdom of
[Nuevo] Leon having died, we were invited to attend the
burial, and accompanied the two governors in their coach,
where we had an opportunity of viewing the solemnity of
the interment, agreeably to the ritual of the Spanish church,
attended by the military honors which were conferred on
the deceased by his late brethren in arms.</p>

<p>[As I ascertained to-day,] Governor Cordero gave the
information of my intended expedition to the commandant-general
as early as July [1806], the same month that I
took my departure. His information was received via
Natchez.</p>

<p><i>June 13th.</i> This morning there were marched 200 dragoons
for the sea-coast, to look out for the English, and
this evening Colonel Cordero was to have marched to join
them. We marched at seven o'clock, Governor Cordero
taking us in his coach about two leagues, accompanied by
Father M'Guire, Dr. Zerbin, etc. We took a friendly adieu
of Governor Herrara and our other friends at Saint Antonio.</p>

<p>It may not be improper to mention here something of
Father M'Guire and Dr. Zerbin, who certainly treated us
with all imaginable attention while at Saint Antonio. The
former was an Irish priest, who formerly resided on the
coast above [New] Orleans [in present Louisiana], and was
noted for his hospitable and social qualities. On the
cession of Louisiana, he followed the standard of "the
king, his master, who never suffers an old servant to be neglected."
He received at Cuba an establishment as chaplain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">700</a></span>
to the mint of Mexico, whence the instability of human
affairs carried him to Saint Antonio. He was a man of
chaste classical taste, observation, and research.</p>

<p>Dr. Zerbin formerly resided at Natchez [in present Mississippi],
but in consequence of pecuniary embarrassments
emigrated to the Spanish territories. Being a young man of
a handsome person and an insinuating address, he had
obtained the good-will of Governor Cordero, who had conferred
on him an appointment in the king's hospital, and
many other advantages by which he might have made a
fortune; but he had recently committed some very great
indiscretions, by which he had nearly lost the favor of
Colonel Cordero, though whilst we were there he was treated
with attention.</p>

<p>I will here attempt to portray a faint resemblance of the
characters of the two governors whom we found at Saint
Antonio; but to whose superexcellent qualities it would
require the pen of a master to do justice.</p>

<p>Don Antonio Cordero is about 5 feet 10 inches in height,
50 years of age, with fair complexion and blue eyes; he
wore his hair turned back, and in every part of his deportment
was legibly written "the soldier." He yet possessed
an excellent constitution, and a body which appeared to be
neither impaired by the fatigues of the various campaigns he
had made, nor disfigured by the numerous wounds received
from the enemies of his king. He was one of the select
officers who had been chosen by the court of Madrid to be
sent to America about 35 years since, to discipline and
organize the Spanish provincials, and had been employed
in all the various kingdoms and provinces of New Spain.
Through the parts which we explored he was universally
beloved and respected; and when I pronounce him by far
the most popular man in the internal provinces, I risk
nothing by the assertion. He spoke the Latin and French
languages well, was generous, gallant, brave, and sincerely
attached to his king and country. Those numerous qualifications
advanced him to the rank of colonel of cavalry, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">701</a></span>
governor of the provinces of Cogquilla and Texas. His
usual residence was Montelovez, which he had embellished
a great deal, but since our taking possession of Louisiana
he had removed to San Antonio, in order to be nearer the
frontier, to be able to apply the remedy to any evil which
might arise from the collision of our lines.</p>

<p>Don Simon de Herrara is about 5 feet 11 inches high, has
a sparkling black eye, dark complexion and hair. He was
born in the Canary islands, served in the infantry in France,
Spain, and Flanders, and speaks the French language well,
with a little of the English. He is engaging in his conversation
with his equals; polite and obliging to his inferiors,
and in all his actions one of the most gallant and accomplished
men I ever knew. He possesses a great knowledge
of mankind from his experience in various countries and
societies, and knows how to employ the genius of each
of his subordinates to advantage. He had been in the
United States during the presidency of General Washington,
and had been introduced to that hero, of whom he
spoke in terms of exalted veneration. He is now lieutenant-colonel
of infantry, and governor of the kingdom of New
Leon. His seat of government is Mont Elrey;
and probably, if ever a chief is adored by his people, it is
Herrara. When his time expired last, he immediately
repaired to Mexico, attended by 300 of the most respectable
people of his government, who carried with them the sighs,
tears, and prayers of thousands that he might be continued
in that government. The viceroy thought proper to
accord to their wishes <i>pro tempore</i>, and the king has since
confirmed his nomination. When I saw him he had been
about one year absent, during which time the citizens of
rank in Mont Elrey had not suffered a marriage or baptism
to take place in any of their families, until their common
father could be there, to consent and give joy to the occasion
by his presence. What greater proof could be given
of their esteem and love?</p>

<p>In drawing a parallel between these two friends, I should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">702</a></span>
say that Cordero was the man of greatest reading, and that
Herrara possessed the greatest knowledge of the world.
Cordero has lived all his life a bachelor. Herrara married
an English lady in early youth, at Cadiz; one who by her
suavity of manners makes herself as much beloved and
esteemed by the ladies as her noble husband is by the
men. By her he has several children, one now an officer
in the service of his royal master.</p>

<p>The two friends agree perfectly in one point&mdash;their hatred
to tyranny of every kind; and in a secret determination
never to see that flourishing part of the New World subject
to any other European lord except him whom they think
their honor and loyalty bound to defend with their lives
and fortunes. But should Bonaparte seize on European
Spain, I risk nothing in asserting that those two gentlemen
would be the first to throw off the yoke, draw their swords,
and assert the independence of their country.</p>

<p>Before I close this subject, it may not be improper to
state that we owe it to Governor Herrara's prudence that
we are not now engaged in a war with Spain. This will be
explained by the following anecdote, which he related in
the presence of his friend Cordero, and which was confirmed
by him. When the difficulties commenced on the Sabine,<a name="FNanchor_IIIP-7" id="FNanchor_IIIP-7" href="#Footnote_IIIP-7" class="fnanchor">[III'-7]</a>
the commandant-general and the viceroy consulted each
other, and mutually determined to maintain inviolate what
they deemed the dominions of their master. The viceroy
therefore ordered Herrara to join Cordero with 1,300 men,
and both the viceroy and General Salcedo ordered Cordero
to cause our troops to be attacked, should they pass the
Rio Oude [<i>sic</i>]. These orders were positively reiterated to
Herrara, the actual commanding officer of the Spanish army
on the frontiers, and gave rise to the many messages which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">703</a></span>
he sent to General Wilkinson when he was advancing with
our troops. Finding they were not attended to, he called
a council of war on the question to attack or not, when it
was given as their opinion that they should immediately
commence a predatory warfare, but avoid a general engagement;
yet, notwithstanding the orders of the viceroy, the
commandant-general, Governor Cordero's, and the opinion
of his officers, he had the firmness or temerity to enter into
the agreement with General Wilkinson which at present
exists relative to our boundaries on that frontier. On his
return he was received with coolness by Cordero, and they
both made their communications to their superiors. "Until
an answer was received," said Herrara, "I experienced the
most unhappy period of my life, conscious I had served my
country faithfully, at the same time that I had violated
every principle of military duty." At length the answer
arrived, and what was it, but the thanks of the viceroy and
the commandant-general for having pointedly disobeyed
their orders, with assurances that they would represent his
services in exalted terms to the king. What could have
produced this change of sentiment is to me unknown, but
the letter was published to the army, and confidence again
restored between the two chiefs and the troops.</p>

<p>Our company consisted of Lieutenant Jn. Echararria,
who commanded the escort; Captain Eugene Marchon of
New Orleans, and Father José Angel Cabaso, who was
bound to the camp at or near the [river] Trinity; with a
suitable proportion of soldiers. We came on 16 miles to
a place called the Beson, where we halted until the mules
came up. Marched again at four o'clock, and arrived at the
river of Guadalupe at eight o'clock. Distance 30 miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIIP-8" id="FNanchor_IIIP-8" href="#Footnote_IIIP-8" class="fnanchor">[III'-8]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">704</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sunday, June 14th.</i> When we left Saint Antonio, everything
appeared to be in a flourishing and improving state,
owing to the examples and encouragement given to industry,
politeness, and civilization by the excellent Governor
Cordero and his colleague Herrara; also to the large body
of troops maintained at that place in consequence of the
difference existing between the United States and Spain.</p>

<p>Came on to the Saint Mark [river, Rio San Marco] in the
morning; in the afternoon came on 15 miles further, but
was late, owing to our having taken the wrong road. Distance
30 miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIIP-9" id="FNanchor_IIIP-9" href="#Footnote_IIIP-9" class="fnanchor">[III'-9]</a></p>

<p><i>June 15th.</i> Marched 20 miles in the morning to a small
pond, which is dry in a dry season, where we halted. Here
commenced the oak timber, it having been musqueet [mesquit,
<i>Prosopis juliflora</i>] in general from Saint Antonio.
Prairie like the Indiana territory. In the afternoon came
on six miles further to a creek, where we encamped early.
Distance 26 miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIIP-10" id="FNanchor_IIIP-10" href="#Footnote_IIIP-10" class="fnanchor">[III'-10]</a></p>

<p><i>June 16th.</i> Marched early, and at eight o'clock arrived
at Red river [Rio Colorado of Texas<a name="FNanchor_IIIP-11" id="FNanchor_IIIP-11" href="#Footnote_IIIP-11" class="fnanchor">[III'-11]</a>]. Here was a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">705</a></span>
Spanish station and several lodges of Tancards&mdash;tall, handsome
men, but the most naked savages I ever saw, without
exception. They complained much of their situation. In
the afternoon passed over hilly, stony land; occasionally
we saw pine timber. Killed one deer. Encamped on a
small run. Distance 26 miles.</p>

<p><i>June 17th.</i> Came on by nine o'clock to a large encampment
of Tancards,<a name="FNanchor_IIIP-12" id="FNanchor_IIIP-12" href="#Footnote_IIIP-12" class="fnanchor">[III'-12]</a> more than 40 lodges. Their poverty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">706</a></span>
was as remarkable as their independence. Immense herds
of horses, etc. I gave a Camanche and Tancard each a
silk handkerchief, and a recommendation to the commandant
at Natchitoches. In the afternoon came on three
hours and encamped on a hill, at a creek on the right-hand
side of the road. Met a large herd of mules escorted by
four soldiers; the lieutenant took from them some money
which they had in charge. Distance 30 miles.</p>

<p><i>June 18th.</i> Rode on until half past ten o'clock, when we
arrived at the river Brassos.<a name="FNanchor_IIIP-13" id="FNanchor_IIIP-13" href="#Footnote_IIIP-13" class="fnanchor">[III'-13]</a> Here is a stockade guard of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">707</a></span>
one corporal, six men, and a ferry-boat. Swam our horses
over; one was drowned and several others were near it,
owing to their striking each other with their feet. We then
came on about two miles on this side of a bayou called the
Little Brassos, which is only a branch of the other, and
which makes an impassable swamp at certain seasons
between them. Distance 31 miles.</p>

<p><i>June 19th.</i> Came on through prairies and woods alternately
20 miles to a small creek, Corpus Christi, with well-wooded,
rich land. In the afternoon came on ten miles,
and passed a creek which at high water is nearly impassable
four miles. Overflows swamps, ponds, etc. Encamped
about one mile on this side, on high land to the right of
the road. Met the mail, Indians, and others. Distance 30
miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIIP-14" id="FNanchor_IIIP-14" href="#Footnote_IIIP-14" class="fnanchor">[III'-14]</a></p>

<p><i>June 20th.</i> Came on 16 miles in the morning; passed
several herds of mustangs or wild horses; good land, ponds
and small dry creeks, prairie and woods, alternately. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">708</a></span>
rained considerably. We halted to dry our baggage long
before night. Distance 20 miles.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, June 21st.</i> Came on to the river Trinity [Rio
Trinidad<a name="FNanchor_IIIP-15" id="FNanchor_IIIP-15" href="#Footnote_IIIP-15" class="fnanchor">[III'-15]</a>] by eight o'clock. Here were stationed two captains,
two lieutenants, and three ensigns, with nearly 100
men, all sick, one scarcely able to assist another. Met a
number of runaway negroes, some French, and Irishmen.
Received information of Lieutenant Wilkinson's safe arrival.
Crossed with all our horses and baggage, with much difficulty.
Distance 20 miles.</p>

<p><i>June 22d.</i> Marched the mules and horses in the forenoon,
but did not depart ourselves until three o'clock.
Father José Angel Cabaso separated from us at this place
for the post of [300 Spanish troops cantoned further down
Trinity river], where he was destined. Passed thick woods,
and a few small prairies with high rich grass. Sent a
dispatch to Nacogdoches. Distance 22 miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIIP-16" id="FNanchor_IIIP-16" href="#Footnote_IIIP-16" class="fnanchor">[III'-16]</a></p>

<p><i>June 23d.</i> Came on 20 miles in the forenoon to a small
creek of standing water; good land and well timbered.
Met a sergeant from Nacogdoches. In the afternoon made
20 miles and crossed the river Natches [or Neches,<a name="FNanchor_IIIP-17" id="FNanchor_IIIP-17" href="#Footnote_IIIP-17" class="fnanchor">[III'-17]</a>] running
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">709</a></span>
N. W. and S. E., 20 yards wide, belly-deep to horses
at this time, but sometimes impassable. Two miles on this
side encamped on a hill in a little prairie. The mules and
loads arrived at twelve o'clock. The sandy soil and pine
timber began again this afternoon, but there was good land
near the river. Distance 40 miles.</p>

<p><i>June 24th.</i> The horses came up this morning; lost six
over night. We marched early and in 15 miles came to the
river Angeline [Rio Angelina], about the width of the
Natchez, running N. and S.; good land on its borders.
Two miles further was a settlement of Barr and Davenport's,
where were three of our lost horses; one mile further
found two more of our horses, where we halted for dinner.
Marched at four o'clock, and at half past eight arrived at
Nacogdoches, where we were politely received by the
adjutant and inspector [Don Francisco Viana], Captain
Herrara, Mr. Davenport, etc. This part of the country is
well watered, but sandy; hilly soil; pine, scrub oak, etc.
Distance 37 miles.</p>

<p><i>June 25th.</i> Spent in reading a gazette from the United
States, etc. A large party at the adjutant and inspector's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">710</a></span>
to dinner: 1st toast, "The President of the United States";
2d, "The King of Spain"; 3d, "Governors Herrara and
Cordero."</p>

<p><i>June 26th.</i> Made preparations to march the next day.
Saw an old acquaintance; also, Lorrimier's son-in-law, from
the district of Cape Jerardeau [Girardeau]. Dined with
the commandant, and spent the evening at Davenport's.</p>

<p><i>June 27th.</i> Marched after dinner and came only 12
miles. Was escorted by Lieutenant Guodiana and a military
party. Mr. Davenport's brother-in-law, who was taking
in some money, also accompanied us.</p>

<p>Don Francis Viana, adjutant and inspector of the Internal
provinces, who commanded at Nacogdoches, is an old and
veteran officer, and was one of those who came to America
at the same time with Colonel Cordero. Possessing a mind
of frankness, he unfortunately spoke his opinions too freely
in some instances, which, finding their way to court, prevented
his promotion. But he is highly respected by his
superiors, and looked up to as a model of military conduct
by his inferiors. He unfortunately does not possess flexibility
sufficient to be useful [to us] in the present state of
the Spanish kingdoms. He is the officer who caused Major
Sparks and Mr. Freeman to return from their expedition on
the Red river [see <a href="#Page_412">p. 412</a>].</p>

<p><i>Sunday, June 28th.</i> Marched early and at nine o'clock
crossed the little river called [Toyac<a name="FNanchor_IIIP-18" id="FNanchor_IIIP-18" href="#Footnote_IIIP-18" class="fnanchor">[III'-18]</a>], whence we pushed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">711</a></span>
on in order to arrive at the house of a Frenchman, [about
nine] miles distant from the Sabine. We stopped at a
house on the road, where the lieutenant informed me an
American by the name of Johnson lived; but was surprised
to find he had crossed the line with his family, and a French
family in his place. When we began conversing with them
they were much alarmed, thinking we had come to examine
them, and expressed great attachment to the Spanish government.
They were somewhat astonished to find I was an
American officer; and on my companions stepping out, expressed
themselves in strong terms of hatred to the Spanish
nation. I excused them for their weakness, and gave them
a caution. Fine land, well watered and timbered; hickory,
oak, sugar-tree, etc. Distance 40 miles.</p>

<p><i>June 29th.</i> Our baggage and horses came up about ten
o'clock, when we dispatched them on. Marched ourselves
at two o'clock, and arrived at the river Sabine by five. Here
we saw the cantonment of the Spanish troops, when they
were commanded by Colonel Herrara, in the late affair between
the two governments. Crossed the Sabine river and
came about one league on this side to a little prairie, where
we encamped. Distance 15 miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIIP-19" id="FNanchor_IIIP-19" href="#Footnote_IIIP-19" class="fnanchor">[III'-19]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">712</a></span></p>

<p>Parted with Lieutenant Guodiana and our Spanish escort.
Here I think proper to bear testimony to the politeness,
civility, and attention of all the officers who at different
periods and in different provinces commanded my escort,
but in a particular manner to Malgares and Barelo, who appeared
studious to please and accommodate, all that lay in
their power; also, the obliging, mild dispositions evinced in
all instances by their rank and file.</p>

<p>On this side of the Sabine I went up to a house, where I
found 10 or 15 Americans hovering near the line, in order to
embrace an opportunity of carrying on some illicit commerce
with the Spaniards, who on their side were equally
eager. Here we found Tharp and Sea, who had been old
sergeants in General Wayne's army.</p>

<p><i>June 30th.</i> Marched early and came 15 miles to a house
at a small creek, where lived a Dutch family named Faulk,
and where we left a small roan horse which had given out.
Marched 12 miles further to a large bayou, where had been
an encampment of our troops, which I recognized by its
form, and took pleasure in imagining the position of the
general's marquee and the tents of my different friends and
acquaintances. Distance 28 [27] miles.<a name="FNanchor_IIIP-20" id="FNanchor_IIIP-20" href="#Footnote_IIIP-20" class="fnanchor">[III'-20]</a></p>

<p><i>July 1st.</i> Finding that a horse of Dr. Robinson's, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">713</a></span>
had come all the way from Chihuahua, could not proceed,
was obliged to leave him here. Yesterday and to-day passed
many Choctaws, whose clothing, furniture, etc., evidently
marked the superiority of situation of those who bordered
on our frontiers, to that of the naked, half-starved wretches
whom we found hanging round the Spanish settlements.
Passed a string of huts, supposed to have been built by our
troops, and at a small run a fortified camp but half a mile
from the hill where anciently stood the village Adyes
[Adayes on the map<a name="FNanchor_IIIP-21" id="FNanchor_IIIP-21" href="#Footnote_IIIP-21" class="fnanchor">[III'-21]</a>]. We proceeded to a spring where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">714</a></span>
we halted for our loads. Finding the horses much fatigued,

<p>1. The administration of Guadalaxara,<a name="FNanchor_IVP-3" id="FNanchor_IVP-3" href="#Footnote_IVP-3" class="fnanchor">[IV'-3]</a> which lies between
18° 30´ and 24° 30´ N. lat., and 104° and 109° W. long., and
is bounded south and west by the South Sea, north by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">720</a></span>
provinces of Biscay [Nueva Viscaya] and Sinaloa; N. E.
by the administration of Zacatecas; E. by the administration
of Guanaxuato, and S. E. by that of Valladolid. It is
350 miles in length from northwest to southeast, and 250
in width east and west. Its population may be estimated
at 100,000. It is one of the most luxuriant and rich administrations
in the viceroyalty; and is watered from east to
west by the great river de Santego [Rio Grande de Santiago],
which receives most of its waters from Lac [Lago]
de Chapala. Guadalaxara, the capital, was built by one of
the Gusman family in 1551, and in 1570 the bishopric was
removed from Compostela to that place. It is the seat of
the audience of Guadalaxara, which includes Guadalaxara
and the administration of Zacatecas. The population of
this city may be estimated at 75,000; it stands in N. lat.
20° 50´, W. long. 105°.</p>

<p>2. The administration of Valladolid<a name="FNanchor_IVP-4" id="FNanchor_IVP-4" href="#Footnote_IVP-4" class="fnanchor">[IV'-4]</a> lies between 22° 10´
and 18° 12´ N. lat., and 102° and 105° W. long., and is
bounded south by the South sea [Pacific ocean] and part of
Mexico, east and northeast by the latter, and north by that
of Guanaxuato. Its greatest length from northeast to southwest
is 230 miles, and its greatest width, east and west, 190
miles. Its population may be estimated at 360,000. Its
capital of the same name is situated in about 20° N. lat.,
103° 25´´ W. long. Population unknown.</p>

<p>3. The administration of Mexico<a name="FNanchor_IVP-5" id="FNanchor_IVP-5" href="#Footnote_IVP-5" class="fnanchor">[IV'-5]</a> lies between 21° 30´
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_721" id="Page_721">721</a></span>
and 16° 30´ N. lat., and 99° and 105° W. long., and is
bounded south by the South Sea, east by the governments
of La Puebla and La Vera Cruz, north by that of St. Louis,
and west by Valladolid and Guanaxuato. Its greatest
length, north and south, may be 360 miles, and its greatest
width, which is on the Western Ocean, is 200 miles. Its
population may be estimated at 1,500,000 souls. The capital
of this administration, and of the whole kingdom, is
Mexico; a particular description of which is deemed unnecessary.
From every information I could obtain from persons
who had resided in it for years, it does not contain
more than 200,000 inhabitants. Its being the residence of
the viceroy, whose court is more splendid than that at
Madrid; its central position as to the ports of Acapulco
and Vera Cruz; together with the rich and luxuriant vale
which surrounds it, will, whenever the Spanish Americans
burst the present bonds of slavery in which they are bound,
give to Mexico all those advantages which great wealth, a
large population, and a commanding situation concentrate,
and assuredly make it one of the greatest cities in the
world. In point of population, it is now in the second
rank, and in beauty, riches, magnificence, and splendor, in
the first.</p>

<p>4. The administration of Oxaca [Oaxaca or Oajaca<a name="FNanchor_IVP-6" id="FNanchor_IVP-6" href="#Footnote_IVP-6" class="fnanchor">[IV'-6]</a>] lies
between 18° and 16° N. lat., and 98° and 112° W. long.,
and is bounded south by the South Sea, west by the government
of La Puebla, north by Mexico and Vera Cruz,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">722</a></span>
and east by the province of Gualamalia [Guatemala]. Its
greatest length, east and west, is 230 miles, and its width,
north and south, 175 miles. Its population may be estimated
at 520,000 souls. Its capital is Oxaca, in 17° 30´ N.
lat., 99° 25´ W. long.</p>

<p>5. The administration of Vera Cruz<a name="FNanchor_IVP-7" id="FNanchor_IVP-7" href="#Footnote_IVP-7" class="fnanchor">[IV'-7]</a> lies between 17°
and 22° N. lat., and 98° and 101° W. long., and is bounded
north and east by the gulf of Mexico, south by Oxaca, west
by Puebla and Mexico. Its greatest length, N. W. and S.
E., is 430 miles, and its width, E. and W., not more than
60 miles. Its population may be estimated at 220,000. Its
capital is Vera Cruz, which is the sole port of entry for all
the kingdom on the Atlantic ocean, as that of Acapulco is
on the Western. Its population may be estimated at 30,000
souls, and is in 19° 10´ N. lat. and 98° 30´ W. long. This
city was taken and sacked by the English on the 17th of
May, 1683, since which the works for its defense [present
Castle of San Juan de Ulúa] have been made so very
strong as almost to bid defiance to an attack from the sea.</p>

<p>6. The administration de la Puebla<a name="FNanchor_IVP-8" id="FNanchor_IVP-8" href="#Footnote_IVP-8" class="fnanchor">[IV'-8]</a> lies between 20° and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">723</a></span>
16° N. lat., and 100° and 102° W. long., and is bounded
south by the South sea, east by Oxaca and Vera Cruz,
north and west by Mexico; it is near 300 miles in its
greatest length from north to south, and 120 in its greatest
width from east to west. Its population may be estimated
at 800,000 souls. Its capital is the city of La Puebla, estimated
at 80,000 souls, which is in 19° 12´ N. lat., and 100°
50´ W. long.</p>

<p>7. The administration of Guanaxuato [or Guanajuato<a name="FNanchor_IVP-9" id="FNanchor_IVP-9" href="#Footnote_IVP-9" class="fnanchor">[IV'-9]</a>]
lies between 21° 30´ and 23° 30´ N. lat., and 103° and 105°
W. long., and is bounded south by Valladolid, east by
Mexico, south by St. Louis [and] Zacataca, and west by
Guadalaxara. Its greatest extent, from north to south, is
75 miles, and from east to west, 85. Its population may
be estimated at 500,000 souls. Its capital city is Guanaxuato,
in lat. 21° N., long. 103° W.</p>

<p>8. The administration of Zacataca [Zacatecas<a name="FNanchor_IVP-10" id="FNanchor_IVP-10" href="#Footnote_IVP-10" class="fnanchor">[IV'-10]</a>] lies between
21° 20´ and 24° 52´ N. lat., and 103° and 105° 30´
W. long., and is bounded north by the internal province of
Biscay, east by St. Louis, west by Guadalaxara, and south by
Guanaxuato. Its greatest length is 210 miles, north and
south, and its greatest width is 145 miles, from east to west.
Its population may be estimated at 250,250 souls. The
capital, Zacataca, stands in 23° N. lat. and 104° W. long.</p>

<p>9. The administration of St. Louis [San Luis Potosí<a name="FNanchor_IVP-11" id="FNanchor_IVP-11" href="#Footnote_IVP-11" class="fnanchor">[IV'-11]</a>]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">724</a></span>
lies between 21° 20´ and 28° 50´ N. lat., and 99° and 102°
W. long., includes Texas and St. Ander [Nuevo Santander]
in this dimension, and is bounded north by New Leon,
east by the province of St. Ander, south by Guanaxuato
and Mexico, and west by Zacataca. Its greatest length
from north to south is 200, and its width from east to west
is 170 miles. Its population may be estimated at 311,500
souls. Its capital is St. Louis de Potosi, the population of
which is 60,000; it stands in 22° N. lat., 103° W. long.,
and was founded in 1568 [1576].</p>

<p>II. The province of Nuevo San Ander [Santander<a name="FNanchor_IVP-12" id="FNanchor_IVP-12" href="#Footnote_IVP-12" class="fnanchor">[IV'-12]</a>] is
bounded north by the province of Texas, west by Nuevo
Leon and Cogquillo [Coahuila], south by St. Louis, and
east by the Atlantic Ocean; from north to south it is about
500 miles in length, but from east to west not more than
150. Its population may be estimated at 38,000 souls.
The capital, New San Ander [Nuevo Santander], is on the
river of that name [also known as the Rio Jimenez, and
Rio de las Palmas], about 40 miles from the sea, in 23° 45´
N. lat. and 101° W. long.</p>

<p>III. The kingdom of New Leon [Nuevo Leon<a name="FNanchor_IVP-13" id="FNanchor_IVP-13" href="#Footnote_IVP-13" class="fnanchor">[IV'-13]</a>] is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">725</a></span>
bounded east by New San Ander, north by Cogquilla,
west by Biscay, and south by St. Louis and Zacataca; its
greatest length north and south is 250 miles; width, east
and west, 100 miles. Its population may be estimated at
30,000 souls. Its capital, Mont El Rey [Monterey], is situated
on the headwaters of Tiger river, which discharges
into the gulf of Mexico. The city of Mont El Rey contains
about 11,000 souls, and is the seat of the bishop,
Don Dio Premiro, who visited the port of Natchitoches
when it was commanded by Captain Turner, of the 2d U.
S. regiment of infantry. His episcopal jurisdiction extends
over Nuevo San Ander, New Leon, Cogquilla, and Texas,
and his salary is equal to $100,000 per annum. Mont El
Rey is situated in 26° N. lat. and 102° W. long. There are
many rich mines near the city of Mont El Rey, whence, I
am informed, there are taken to be coined 100 mule-loads
of bullion in silver and gold monthly, which may be presumed
to be not more than the three-fifths of what is taken
from the mines, as there are many persons who prefer never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">726</a></span>
getting their metal coined, as then it is not so easily ascertained
what they are worth, which is an all-important secret
in a despotic government.</p>

<p class="p2">The foregoing nine administrations or intendencias, the
province of Nuevo San Ander, and the kingdom of [Nuevo]
Leon, are included in the two audiences of Guadalaxara
and Mexico, and form, as I believe, the whole political government
of the viceroy of Mexico; but I am not positive
whether his jurisdiction does not include the audience of
Guatimalia [Guatemala], which lies to the south, and includes
the province of that name, that of Chiapa [Chiapas],
Yucatan, Veraqua [Veragua], Costa Rica, and Honduras.
An audience is the high court of appeals in which the
viceroy presides and has two votes; it is intended as a
check on his power and authority.</p>

<p>The administrations are governed by intendants, who are
officers of high rank, and always Europeans.</p>

<p>The longitude given is from the meridian of Paris.</p>

<p>In the general view of New Spain,<a name="FNanchor_IVP-14" id="FNanchor_IVP-14" href="#Footnote_IVP-14" class="fnanchor">[IV'-14]</a> I shall take some
notice of the manners, customs, political force, etc., of the
viceroyalty; but, as I do not pretend to be correctly
informed as to that quarter of the kingdom, and there have
been so many persons who have given statements on those
heads, I shall confine my observations principally to the
internal provinces through which I passed, and on which I
made my observations.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">727</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">INTERNAL PROVINCES.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">New Mexico.</span> [<i>Geography.</i> The province of New
Mexico] lies between lat. 30° 30´ and 44° N., and long. 104°
and 108° W., and is the most northern province of the kingdom
of New Spain. It extends northwest into an undefined
boundary, is bounded north and east by Louisiana, south by
Biscay and Cogquilla, and west by Senora and California.<a name="FNanchor_IVP-15" id="FNanchor_IVP-15" href="#Footnote_IVP-15" class="fnanchor">[IV'-15]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">728</a></span>
Its length is unknown; its breadth may be 600 miles; but
the inhabited part is not more than 400 miles in length and
50 in breadth, lying along the river del Norte, from lat. 37°
to 31° 30´ N.; but in this space there is a desert of more
than 250 miles.</p>

<p><i>Air and Climate.</i> No persons accustomed to reside in
the temperate climate of lat. 36° and 37° N. in the United
States can form any idea of the piercing cold which is experienced
on that parallel in New Mexico; but the air is
serene and unaccompanied by damps or fogs, as it rains but
once a year, and some years not at all. It is a mountainous
country. The grand dividing ridges which separate the
waters of the rio del Norte from those of California border
it on the line of its western limits, and are covered, in some
places, with eternal snows, which give a keenness to the air
that could not be calculated upon or expected in a temperate
zone.</p>

<p><i>Timber and Plains.</i> The cotton tree [<i>Populus</i>] is the
only tree of this province, except some scrubby pines and
cedars at the foot of the mountains [and many other species
there and elsewhere]. The former borders the banks of the
rio del Norte and its tributary streams. All the rest of
the country presents to the eye a barren wild of poor land,
scarcely to be improved by culture, and appears to be only
capable of producing sufficient subsistence for those animals
which live on succulent plants and herbage.</p>

<p><i>Mines, Minerals, and Fossils.</i> There are no mines known
in the province, except one of copper situated in a mountain
on the west side of the rio del Norte, in lat. 34° N. [see
<a href="#Footnote_IP-26">note<sup>26</sup>, p. 637</a>]. It is worked, and produces 20,000 mule-loads
of copper annually. It also furnishes that article for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">729</a></span>
the manufactories of nearly all the internal provinces. It
contains gold, but not quite sufficient to pay for its extraction;
consequently it has not been pursued.</p>

<p>There is, near Santa Fe, in some of the mountains, a
stratum of talc, which is so large and flexible as to render it
capable of being subdivided into thin flakes, of which the
greater proportion of the houses in Santa Fe, and in all the
villages to the north, have their window-lights made.</p>

<p><i>Rivers.</i> The river del Norte takes its source in the
mountains which give birth to the headwaters of California,
the Plata [South Platte], Pierre Jaune ["Yellowstone," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
North Platte] of the Missouri, and Arkansaw of the Mississippi,
in lat. 40° N. and long. 110° W.<a name="FNanchor_IVP-16" id="FNanchor_IVP-16" href="#Footnote_IVP-16" class="fnanchor">[IV'-16]</a> Its distance from
its source to the gulf of Mexico may be, by its meanders,
estimated at 2,000 miles, passing through the provinces of
New Mexico, part of Biscay, Cogquilla, and New San Ander,
where it falls into the gulf at lat. 26° N. It cannot, in any
part of its course, be termed a navigable stream, owing to
the sand-bars. In the flat country and mountains in the
upper part, with which its course is interrupted, small boats
might ascend as high as the Presidio de Rio Grande in Cogquilla,
and it might be navigable for canoes in various parts
of its course. In the mountains above Santa Fe it afforded
amply sufficient water for canoe navigation, and even more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">730</a></span>
than appeared to be flowing in its bed in the plains. This
must be attributed to numerous canals and the dry sandy
soil through which the river courses, where much of the
water which flows from the mountains must be absorbed
and lost. In the province of New Mexico it is called the
Rio del Norte; below it is termed the Rio Grande; but in
no instance did I hear it called the Rio Bravo, as many of
our ancient maps designate it.</p>

<p>There are also, in the limits of this province, to the west,
the rivers San Rafael, San Xavier, de los Dolores, also de
los Anamas or Nabajoa, all of which join and form the great
Rio Colorado of California.<a name="FNanchor_IVP-17" id="FNanchor_IVP-17" href="#Footnote_IVP-17" class="fnanchor">[IV'-17]</a> The two first take their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">731</a></span>
sources in the same mountains as the Rio del Norte, but on
the west side.</p>

<p>The river Colorado, by its meanders, may be about 1,000
miles in length, from its sources to its discharge into the
head of the gulf of California, in the 33d degree of N. lat.
[about 32°]. It has been represented to me, by men of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">732</a></span>
information and research, to be navigable for square-rigged
vessels at least 300 miles from the gulf. By this river and
the Arkansaw there could be the best communication established
between the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans. There
are represented to be various numerous and warlike nations
of Indians on its banks. Through the whole of its course
its banks are entirely destitute of timber, and indeed I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_733" id="Page_733">733</a></span>
informed that for 300 miles there was not a tree ten inches
in diameter.</p>

<p>The river S. Buenaventura empties into the Pacific ocean
to the north of California in 39° 30´ N. latitude, and takes its
source in the Sierre Madre to the north of the Colorado and
del Norte.<a name="FNanchor_IVP-18" id="FNanchor_IVP-18" href="#Footnote_IVP-18" class="fnanchor">[IV'-18]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_734" id="Page_734">734-735</a></span></p>

<p>The Rio Gila<a name="FNanchor_IVP-19" id="FNanchor_IVP-19" href="#Footnote_IVP-19" class="fnanchor">[IV'-19]</a> heads opposite the copper-mines, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735"></a></span>
discharges into the gulf of California, just below the Colorado,
in the 33d degree of N. latitude.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_736" id="Page_736">736</a></span></p>

<p>The Rio Puerto [Pecos<a name="FNanchor_IVP-20" id="FNanchor_IVP-20" href="#Footnote_IVP-20" class="fnanchor">[IV'-20]</a>] is a branch of the Rio del
Norte; it comes from the north and joins that river about
100 miles below the Presidio del Norte.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_737" id="Page_737">737</a></span></p>

<p>None of the foregoing streams present any evidence of
civilization on their shores excepting the Rio del Norte.</p>

<p><i>Lakes.</i> I heard of no lakes in the province, except that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">738</a></span>
of Tampanagos, the existence of which I consider very
doubtful. It is said to commence, according to Father
Escalante, in the 40th deg. N. lat., and to have been explored
to the 42d deg. in a N. W. direction, where it
enlarged its dimensions, and the discoverer thought proper
to return.<a name="FNanchor_IVP-21" id="FNanchor_IVP-21" href="#Footnote_IVP-21" class="fnanchor">[IV'-21]</a></p>

<p><i>Animals.</i> North Mexico produces deer, elk, buffalo,
cabrie, the gresley [grizzly and] black bear, and wild horses.</p>

<p><i>Population.</i> Its population is not far short of 30,000
souls, one-twentieth of which may be Spaniards from
Europe, or Chapetones [Gachupines<a name="FNanchor_IVP-22" id="FNanchor_IVP-22" href="#Footnote_IVP-22" class="fnanchor">[IV'-22]</a>], four-twentieths
Creoles, five-twentieths Metifs, and the other half civilized
Indians.</p>

<p>The capital is Santa Fe, situated on a small stream which
empties into the east side of the Rio del Norte, at the foot
of the mountains which divide the waters of that river
from the Arkansaw and the Red river of the Mississippi,
in 36° N. lat. and 100° W. long. It is an oblong square,
extending about one mile from east to west on the banks
of the creek. In the centre is the public square, one side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739">739</a></span>
of which forms the flank of the soldiers' square, which is
closed and in some degree defended by the round towers
in the angles which flank the four curtains; another side
of the square is formed by the palace of the governor, his
guard-houses, etc.; the third side is occupied by the priests
and their suite, and the fourth by the Chapetones who
reside in the city. The houses are generally only one
story high, with flat roofs, and have a very mean appearance
on the outside; but some of them are richly furnished,
especially with plate.</p>

<p>The second cities in the province are Albuquerque and
Passo [El Paso] del Norte. The latter is the most southern
city of the province, as Tons [Taos] is the most northern.
Between the village of Sibilleta and the Passo there is a
wilderness of near 200 miles [including the Jornada del
Muerto].</p>

<p><i>Trade and Commerce.</i> New Mexico carries on a trade
direct with Mexico through Biscay [Nueva Viscaya], also
with Senora [Sonora] and Sinaloa; it sends out about
30,000 sheep annually, tobacco, dressed deer and cabrie
skins, some furs, buffalo robes, salt, and wrought copper
vessels of a superior quality. It receives in return, from
Biscay and Mexico, dry goods, confectionery, arms, iron,
steel, ammunition, and some choice European wines and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740">740</a></span>
liquors; from Senora and Sinaloa, gold, silver, and cheese.
The following articles sell in this province, as stated, which
will show the cheapness of provisions and the extreme
dearness of imported goods: Flour sells, per hundred, at
$2; salt, per mule-load, $5; sheep, each, $1; beeves, each,
$5; wine del Passo, per barrel, $15; horses, each, $11;
mules, each, $30; superfine cloths, per yard, $25; fine
cloths, per yard, $20; linen, per yard, $4, and all other dry
goods in proportion.</p>

<p>The journey with loaded mules from Santa Fe to Mexico,
and returning to Santa Fe, takes five months. They
manufacture rough leather, cigars, a vast variety and quantity
of potters' ware, cotton, some coarse woolen cloths,
and blankets of a superior quality. All those manufactures
are carried on by the civilized Indians, as the Spaniards
think it more honorable to be agriculturists than mechanics.
The Indians likewise far exceed their conquerors in their
genius for, and execution of, all mechanical operations.</p>

<p>About two miles above the town of Passo del Norte is a
bridge over the river, where the road passes to the west
side, at which place is a large canal [acequia]. This takes
out an ample supply of water for the purpose of cultivation,
which is here carried on in as great perfection as at any
place that I visited in the provinces. There is a wall
bordering the canal the whole way on both sides, to protect
it from the animals; and when it arrives at the village,
it is distributed in such a manner that each person has his
fields watered in rotation. At this place were as finely
cultivated fields of wheat and other small grain as I ever
saw; and numerous vineyards, from which were produced
the finest wine ever drank in the country, which was celebrated
through all the provinces, and was the only wine
used on the table of the commanding general.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture.</i> They cultivate corn, wheat, rye, barley,
rice, tobacco, vines, and all the common culinary plants
cultivated in the same latitude in the United States. New
Mexico has the exclusive right of cultivating tobacco. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741">741</a></span>
are, however, a century behind us in the art of cultivation;
for, notwithstanding their numerous herds of cattle and
horses, I have seen them frequently breaking up whole
fields with a hoe. Their oxen draw by the horns, after
the French mode. Their carts are extremely awkward and
clumsily made. During the whole of the time we were
in New Spain I never saw a horse in a vehicle of any
description, mules being made use of in carriages, as well
as for the purposes of labor.</p>

<p><i>Antiquities.</i> On the river St. Francis,<a name="FNanchor_IVP-23" id="FNanchor_IVP-23" href="#Footnote_IVP-23" class="fnanchor">[IV'-23]</a> a large branch of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_742" id="Page_742">742</a></span>
the river Gila, which heads near the copper mines in New
Mexico and discharges into the Red river of California,
are the remains of old walls and houses which are ascertained
to have been the work of the Mexicans on their
route emigrating from the northwest to the plains of Mexico,
where they finally established themselves. Those walls
are of a black cement, the durability of which increases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">743</a></span>
with its age, so that it has hitherto bid defiance to the war
of time. Its composition is now entirely lost. There is
also found at this place many broken pieces of earthenware,
which still possess the glazing as perfectly as when first
put on.</p>

<p><i>Aborigines.</i><a name="FNanchor_IVP-24" id="FNanchor_IVP-24" href="#Footnote_IVP-24" class="fnanchor">[IV'-24]</a> The Kyaways [Kiowas] wander on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744">744</a></span>
sources of La Platte and are supposed to be 1,000 men
strong. They possess immense herds of horses, and are at
war with both Pawnees and Tetaus [Ietans, Comanches],
as well as the Sioux. They are armed with bows, arrows,
and lances, and hunt the buffalo. This nation, with the
Tetaus and Utahs, all speak the same language. The Utahs
wander at the sources of the Rio del Norte, are supposed
to be 2,000 warriors strong, are armed in the same manner,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">745</a></span>
and pursue the same game, as the Kyaways. They are,
however, a little more civilized, from having more connection
with the Spaniards, with whom they are frequently at
war, but were then at peace, and waging war with the
Tetaus.<a name="FNanchor_IVP-25" id="FNanchor_IVP-25" href="#Footnote_IVP-25" class="fnanchor">[IV'-25]</a></p>

<p>A battle was fought between them and the Tetaus in
September, 1806, near the village of Tons [Taos]: there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">746</a></span>
were about 400 combatants on each side, but they were
separated by a Spanish alcalde riding out to the field of
battle. There were 8 or 10 killed on each side. The Utahs
gave all the horses taken to the Spaniards. This shows in a
strong degree the influence the Spaniards have over those
Indians.</p>

<p>The Nanahaws [Navajos<a name="FNanchor_IVP-26" id="FNanchor_IVP-26" href="#Footnote_IVP-26" class="fnanchor">[IV'-26]</a>] are situated to the N. W. of
Santa Fe. They frequently war with the Spaniards, and are
supposed to be 2,000 warriors strong. They are armed in
the same manner as the two preceding nations. This
nation, as well as all the others to the west of them bordering
on California, speak the language of the Appaches and
Le Panis [Lipans<a name="FNanchor_IVP-27" id="FNanchor_IVP-27" href="#Footnote_IVP-27" class="fnanchor">[IV'-27]</a>], who are in a line with them to the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_747" id="Page_747">747</a></span></p>

<p>The Appaches<a name="FNanchor_IVP-28" id="FNanchor_IVP-28" href="#Footnote_IVP-28" class="fnanchor">[IV'-28]</a> are a nation of Indians who extend from
the Black mountains in New Mexico to the frontiers of
Cogquilla, keeping the frontiers of three provinces in a continual
state of alarm, and making it necessary to employ
nearly 2,000 dragoons to escort the caravans, protect the
villages, and revenge the various attacks they are continually
making on the subjects of his Catholic Majesty. This
nation formerly extended from the entrance of the Rio
Grande to the Gulf of California, and have waged a continual
warfare, excepting short truces, with the Spaniards,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">748</a></span>
from the time these pushed their enterprises back from
Mexico into the internal provinces. It is extremely difficult
to say what are their numbers at the present day, but they
must be very much reduced, from their long and constant
warfare, the wandering and savage life they lead in the
mountains, which is so injurious to an increase of population,
and in which they are frequently extremely pinched
by famine.</p>

<p>At the commencement of their warfare the Spaniards
used to take them prisoners and make slaves of them; but
finding that their unconquerable attachment to liberty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749">749</a></span>
made them surmount every difficulty and danger in returning
to their mountains, they adopted the mode of sending
them to Cuba. This the Appaches no sooner learned than
they refused to give or receive quarter, and in no instance
have any been taken since that period, except those surprised
when asleep, or knocked down and overpowered.</p>

<p>Their arms are the bow and arrow, and the lance. Their
bow forms two demi-circles, with a shoulder in the middle;
the back of it is entirely covered with sinews, which are
laid on in so nice a manner, by the use of some glutinous
substance, as to be almost imperceptible; this gives great
elasticity to the weapon. Their arrow is more than the
"cloth yard" of the English, being three feet and a half
long, the upper part consisting of some light rush or cane,
into which is inserted a shaft of about one foot, made of
some hard, seasoned light wood; the point is of iron, bone,
or stone, and, when the arrow enters the body, in attempting
to extract it the shaft comes out of its socket and the
point remains in the wound. With this weapon they shoot
with such force as to go through the body of a man at a
distance of 100 yards, and an officer told me that in an
engagement with them, one of their arrows struck his shield
and dismounted him in an instant. Their other weapon of
offense is a lance of 15 feet in length, with which they
charge with both hands over their heads, managing their
horses principally with their knees. With this weapon they
are considered an overmatch for any Spanish dragoon
single-handed; but, for want of a knowledge of tactics,
they can never stand the charge of a body which acts in
concert. They all carry shields. Some few are armed
with guns and ammunition taken from the Spaniards.
Those, as well as the archers, generally march to war on
foot; but the lancemen are always mounted. Numerous
are the anecdotes I have heard related of their personal
bravery and the spirit of their partisan corps. Not long
before I went into that country a cornet, with 63 dragoons,
between New Mexico and Biscay, was surrounded by about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_750" id="Page_750">750</a></span>
200 Apaches' infantry. Instead of charging through them,
as [he should have done, since] it was on the plain, he
ordered his dragoons to dismount and fight with their carabines;
in consequence of which he and his whole party fell
a sacrifice.</p>

<p>Malgares related an instance when he was marching with
140 men and they were attacked by a party of Appaches,
both horse and foot, who continued the fight for four hours.
Whenever the Spanish dragoons would make a general
charge, the Appaches' cavalry would retreat behind their
infantry, who met the Spaniards with a shower of arrows,
who immediately retreated; and even the gallant Malgares
spoke of the Spanish cavalry's breaking the Appaches infantry
as a thing not to be thought of.</p>

<p>Malgares assured me that, if the Appaches had seconded
the efforts and bravery of their chieftain, the Spaniards
must have been defeated and cut to pieces; that in various
instances he rallied his men and brought them up to the
charge, and that when they fled, he retired indignantly to
the rear. Seeing Malgares very actively engaged in forming
and bringing up the Spaniards, the Appache chieftain rode
out ahead of his party and challenged him to single combat
with his lance. This my friend refused, as he said that the
chief was one of the stoutest men he knew, carried a remarkably
heavy lance, and rode a very fine charger; but one
of his corporals, enraged to see the Spaniards thus braved
by this savage, begged permission to meet the "infidel."
His officer refused his request and ordered him to keep his
ranks; but he reiterating the request, his superior in a
passion told him to go. The Indian chief had turned his
horse to join his party, but seeing an enemy advancing, he
turned, gave a shout, and met him at full speed. The
dragoon thought to parry the lance of his antagonist, which
he in part effected; but not throwing it quite high enough,
it entered his neck before and came out at the nape, when
he fell dead to the ground, and his victorious enemy gave a
shout of victory, in which he was joined by all his followers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_751" id="Page_751">751</a></span>
This enraged the Spaniards to such a degree that they made
a general charge, in which the Indian cavalry again retreated,
notwithstanding the entreaties of their gallant leader.</p>

<p>In another instance a small smoke was discovered on the
prairie; three poor savages were surrounded by 100 dragoons
and ordered to lay down their arms; they smiled at
the officer's demand, and asked him if he could suppose that
men who had arms in their hands would ever consent to
become slaves. The officer, being loath to kill them, held
a conference for an hour; when, finding that his threats
had as little effect as his entreaties, he ordered his men to
attack them at a distance, keeping out of the reach of their
arrows, and firing at them with their carabines, which they
did, the Indians never ceasing to resist as long as life
remained.</p>

<p>In a truce which was held a Spanish captain was ordered
to treat with some of the bands. He received their deputies
with hauteur, and they could not come upon terms. The
truce was broken, and the Indians retreated to their fastnesses
in the mountains. In a day or two this same officer
pursued them. They were in a place called the Door in the
Mountain, where but two or three dragoons could enter at
a time, and there were rocks and caves on the flanks behind
which the Indians secreted themselves until a number of the
Spaniards had come in. Then the Indians sounded a
trumpet; the attack began, and continued on the side of
the Appaches until the Spanish captain fell, when the Indian
chief caused the firing to cease, saying that the man who
had so haughtily spurned the proffered peace was now
dead. On this occasion they deviated from their accustomed
rule of warfare, and made a prisoner of a young
officer, who, during the truce, had treated them with great
kindness, and sent him home safe and unhurt.</p>

<p>Some of the bands have made temporary truces with the
Spaniards, and received from them 25 cents per diem each.
Those people hang round the fortifications of the country,
drink, shoot, and dissipate their time; they are haughty and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_752" id="Page_752">752</a></span>
independent. Great jealousy exists between them and the
Spaniards. An officer was under trial, when I was in the
country, for anticipating an attack on his fortress by attacking
the chiefs of the supposed conspiracy, and putting them
to death before they had time to mature and carry their
plan into execution. The decision of his case I never
learned; but those savages who have been for some time
about the forts and villages become by far the most dangerous
enemies the Spaniards have, when hostile, as they
have acquired the Spanish language, manners, and habits,
pass through the populated parts under the disguise of
civilized and friendly Indians, commit murders and robberies,
and are not suspected. There is in the province of
Cogquilla a partisan by the name of Ralph, who, they calculate,
has killed more than 300 persons. He comes into
the towns under the disguise of a peasant, buys provisions,
goes to the gambling-tables and to mass, and before he
leaves the village is sure to kill some person or carry off a
woman, which he has frequently done. Sometimes he joins
people traveling on the road, insinuates himself into their
confidence, and takes his opportunity to assassinate them.
He has only six followers, and from their knowledge of the
country, activity, and cunning, he keeps about 300 Spanish
dragoons continually employed. The government has
offered $1,000 for his head.</p>

<p>The civilized Indians of the province of New Mexico are
of what were formerly 24 different bands, the different
names of which I did not become acquainted with, but the
Keres were one of the most powerful; they form at present
the population of St. Domingo, St. Philips, Deis, and one
or two other towns.<a name="FNanchor_IVP-29" id="FNanchor_IVP-29" href="#Footnote_IVP-29" class="fnanchor">[IV'-29]</a> They are men of large stature, round
full visage, fine teeth, appear to be of a gentle, tractable
disposition, and resemble the Osage more than any nation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_753" id="Page_753">753</a></span>
of whom I possess any knowledge. They are not the vassals
of individuals, yet may properly be termed the slaves
of the State, for they are compelled to do military duty,
drive mules, carry loads, or, in fact, perform any other act
of duty or bondage that the will of the commandant of the
district, or of any passing military tyrant, chooses to ordain.</p>

<p>I was myself eye-witness of a scene which made my heart
bleed for those poor wretches, at the same time that it
excited my indignation and contempt, that they would suffer
themselves, with arms in their hands, to be beaten and
knocked about by beings no ways their superiors, unless a
small tint of complexion could be supposed to give that
superiority. Before we arrived at Santa Fe, one night, we
were near one of the villages where resided the families of
two of our Indian horsemen. They took the liberty to pay
them a visit in the night. Next morning the whole of the
Indian horsemen were called up, and because they refused
to testify against their imprudent companions, several were
knocked down from their horses by the Spanish dragoons
with the butt of their lances; yet, with the blood streaming
down their visages, and arms in their hands, they stood cool
and tranquil&mdash;not a frown, not a word of discontent or palliation
escaped their lips. Yet what must have been the
boiling indignation of their souls at the indignities offered
by the wretch clothed with a little brief authority! The
day of retribution will come in thunder and in vengeance.</p>

<p>Those savages are armed with bow and arrows, and with
lances, or escopates. Although they are said to be converted
to Christianity, they still retain many of their ancient
rituals, feasts, and ceremonies, one of which is so remarkable
it must not be passed unnoticed. Once a year there is a
great feast prepared for three successive days, which they
spend in eating, drinking, and dancing. Near this scene of
amusement is a dark cave, into which not a glimpse of light
can penetrate, and in which are prepared places to repose on.
To this place persons of all description, of both sexes and
of all ages, after puberty, repair in the night, when there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_754" id="Page_754">754</a></span>
an indiscriminate commerce of the votaries, as chance, fortune,
and events direct. Those revels certainly have great
affinity to some of the ancient mystic rites of Greece and
Rome.</p>

<p><i>Government and Laws.</i> The government of New Mexico
may be termed military, in the pure sense of the word; for
although they have their alcaldes, or inferior officers, their
judgments are subject to a reversion by the military commandants
of districts. The whole male population are subject
to military duty, without pay or emolument, and are
obliged to find their own horses, arms, and provision. The
only thing furnished by the government is ammunition. It
is extraordinary with what subordination they act when
they are turned out to do military duty. A strong proof of
this was exhibited in the expedition of Malgares to the
Pawnees. His command consisted of 100 dragoons of the
regular service and 500 drafts from the province. He had
continued down the Red river until their provision began to
be short; they then demanded of the lieutenant where he
was bound and the intention of the expedition. To this he
haughtily replied, "Wherever my horse leads me." A few
mornings after he was presented with a petition, signed by
200 of the militia, to return home. He halted immediately,
caused his dragoons to erect a gallows, and then beat to
arms. The troops fell in; he separated the petitioners from
the others, then took the man who had presented the petition,
tied him up and gave him 50 lashes, and threatened
to put to death, on the gallows erected, any man who
should dare to grumble. This effectually silenced them,
and quelled the rising spirit of sedition; but it was remarked
that it was the first instance of a Spaniard receiving corporal
punishment ever known in the province.</p>

<p><i>Morals, Manners, etc.</i> There is nothing peculiarly characteristic
in this province that will not be embraced in my
general observations on New Spain, except that, being on
the frontier and cut off, as it were, from the more inhabited
parts of the kingdom, together with their continual wars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_755" id="Page_755">755</a></span>
with some of the savage nations who surround them, renders
the people the bravest and most hardy subjects in New
Spain; being generally armed, they know the use of arms.
Their want of gold and silver renders them laborious, in
order that the productions of their labor may be the means
of establishing the equilibrium between them and the other
provinces where those metals abound. Their isolated and
remote situation also causes them to exhibit, in a superior
degree, the heaven-like qualities of hospitality and kindness,
in which they appear to endeavor to fulfill the injunction of
the scripture which enjoins us to feed the hungry, clothe
the naked, and give comfort to the oppressed in spirit; and
I shall always take pleasure in expressing my gratitude for
their noble reception of myself and the men under my
command.</p>

<p><i>Military Force.</i> There is but one troop of dragoons in
all New Mexico of the regular force, which is stationed at
Santa Fe, and is 100 strong. Of this troop the governor is
always the captain, entitling himself captain of the royal
troop of Santa Fe dragoons; but they are commanded by
a first lieutenant, who is captain by brevet. The men
capable of bearing arms in this province may be estimated
at 5,000, of which probably 1,000 are completely armed, 1,000
badly, and the rest not at all.</p>

<p><i>Religion.</i> The catholic religion is practiced in this province
after the same manner as in the other provinces, and
will hereafter be taken notice of generally.</p>

<p><i>History.</i> In the year 1594 two friars came out from Old
Mexico to New Mexico, and were well received by the savages.
They returned, and the ensuing year Juan de Ouate,<a name="FNanchor_IVP-30" id="FNanchor_IVP-30" href="#Footnote_IVP-30" class="fnanchor">[IV'-30]</a>
a monk, went out, explored the country, and returned.
After this 100 troops and 500 men, women, and children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_756" id="Page_756">756</a></span>
came out and settled on the Rio del Norte, at some no very
great distance from where Santa Fe now stands. They
entered into an arrangement with the Indians on the subject
of their establishment; but a few years after [in 1680]
the Indians rose <i>en masse</i>, fell on the Spaniards by surprise,
killed most of the soldiers, and obliged them to retreat to
the Passo del Norte; whence it acquired its name. Here
they awaited a re-enforcement from Biscay, which they
received, of 70 men and two field-pieces, with which they
recommenced their march and finally arrived at Santa Fe,
then the capital Indian village, to which they immediately
laid siege. The Indians maintained themselves 22 days,
when they surrendered and entered into a second negotiation;
since which time the Spaniards have been engaged in
continual warfare with the various savage tribes which surround
them on all sides. These have been near ruining the
Spaniards several times, and obliged them to apply for
re-enforcements from Biscay and Senora. A few years since
the Tetaus carried on a warm and vigorous war against
them, but are now at peace and considered as their firmest
allies.</p>

<p>In the history of New Mexico it may not be improper to
record the name of James Pursley, the first American who
ever penetrated the immense wilds of Louisiana, and showed
the Spaniards of New Mexico that neither the savages who
surround the deserts which divide them from the habitable
world, nor the jealous tyranny of their rulers, was sufficient
to prevent the enterprising spirit of the Americans from
penetrating the arcanum of their rich establishment in the
new world. Pursley was from near Baird's town, Kentucky,
which he left in 1799. In 1802, with two companions, he
left St. Louis and traveled west, on the head of the Osage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_757" id="Page_757">757</a></span>
river, where they made a hunt; thence they struck for the
White river of the Arkansaw, and intended to descend it to
Orleans; but, while making preparations, the Kans stole
their horses. They secured their peltries, and pursued the
Kans into the village. The horses were there, but the Indians
refused to give them up. Pursley saw his horse, with an
Indian on him, going to the water at the edge of the town,
pursued him, and with his knife ripped open the horse's
bowels. The Indian returned to the village, got his gun,
and came and snapped it at Pursley, who pursued him into
the village with his knife. The Indian took refuge in a
lodge surrounded by women and children. This struck the
chiefs with astonishment and admiration of the "mad
Americans," as they termed them, and they returned the
other horses to the hunters. This anecdote was related by
traders who had been in the village at the time.</p>

<p>Pursley and his companions then returned to where they
had buried their peltry, and determined to pursue the route
by land to St. Louis; but some persons stole their horses a
second time, when they were at no great distance from the
Osage river, on which they formed a rough canoe and
descended that stream. Near the entrance of the Missouri
they overset their canoe and lost their whole year's hunt,
but saved their arms and ammunition, which is always the
primary object in a desert. On the Missouri they met
Monsieur [Blank] in his barge, bound to the Mandanes.
Pursley embarked with him for the voyage; his two companions
preferred returning to their homes. On their
arrival at the point of destination, his employer dispatched
Pursley on a hunting and trading tour with some bands of
the Paducahs and Kyaways, with a small quantity of merchandise.
In the ensuing spring they were driven from the
plains by the Sioux into the mountains which give birth to
La Platte, the Arkansaw, etc., and it was their sign which
we saw in such amazing abundance on the headwaters of
La Platte [in South Park, Col., Dec. 16, 1806]. Their party
consisted of near 2,000 souls, with 10,000 beasts. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_758" id="Page_758">758</a></span>
Indians, knowing they were approximating to New Mexico,
determined to send Pursley, with his companions and two
of their body, into Santa Fe, to know of the Spaniards if
they would receive them friendly and enter into a trade
with them. This being acceded to by Governor Allencaster,
the Indian deputies returned for their bands; but Pursley
thought proper to remain with a civilized people, among
whom a fortuitous event had thrown him&mdash;a circumstance of
which, he assured me, he had at one time entirely despaired.</p>

<p>He arrived at Santa Fe in June, 1805, and has been following
his trade as a carpenter ever since; at this he made
a great deal of money, except when working for the officers,
who paid him little or nothing. He was a man of strong
natural sense and dauntless intrepidity. He entertained
me with numerous interesting anecdotes of his adventures
with the Indians, and of the jealousy of the Spanish government.
He was once near being hanged for making a few
pounds of gunpowder, which he innocently did as he had
been accustomed to do in Kentucky, but which is a capital
crime in these provinces. He still retained the gun which
he had with him his whole tour, and said confidently that
if he had two hours' start not all the province could take
him. He was forbidden to write, but was assured he should
have a passport whenever he demanded it, and was obliged
to give security that he would not leave the country without
permission of the government. He assured me that he
had found gold on the head of La Platte, and had carried
some of the virgin mineral in his shot-pouch for months;
but that, being in doubt whether he should ever again
behold the civilized world, and losing in his mind all the
ideal value which mankind have stamped on that metal, he
threw the sample away. He had imprudently mentioned it
to the Spaniards, who had frequently solicited him to go
and show a detachment of cavalry the place; but, conceiving
it to be in our territory, he had refused, and was fearful
that the circumstance might create a great obstacle to his
leaving the country.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_759" id="Page_759">759</a></span></p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Biscay.</span> <i>Geography.</i> [The province of Nueva Vizcaya<a name="FNanchor_IVP-31" id="FNanchor_IVP-31" href="#Footnote_IVP-31" class="fnanchor">[IV'-31]</a>]
lies between lat. 33° and 24° N., and long. 105° and 111° W.
It is bounded on the north by New Mexico, on the west by
Senora and Sinaloa, and on the east by New Leon and
Cogquilla. It is 600 miles in length from northwest to
southeast, and 400 miles in width from east to west, taking
it at its greatest extent.</p>

<p><i>Air and Climate.</i> The air is dry and the heat very great
at that season of the year which precedes the rainy season,
which latter commences in June and continues until September
by light showers. During the other part of the
year there is not the least rain or snow to moisten the earth.
The atmosphere had therefore become so electrified that
when we halted at night, in taking off our blankets the
electric fluid would almost cover them with sparks, and in
Chihuahua we prepared a bottle with gold-leaf as a receiver,
and collected sufficient electric fluid from a bear-skin
to give a considerable shock to a number of persons. This
phenomenon was more conspicuous in the vicinity of Chihuahua
than in any other part that we passed over.<a name="FNanchor_IVP-32" id="FNanchor_IVP-32" href="#Footnote_IVP-32" class="fnanchor">[IV'-32]</a></p>

<p><i>Mines and Minerals.</i> This province abounds in silver
and gold mines, which yield an immense quantity of those
metals, but not so great a revenue to the king as those
which are nearer the mint, and consequently present a
greater facility to coinage. I am not acquainted with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_760" id="Page_760">760</a></span>
proportion of the metals which the mineral yields in any
instance, except in one of the silver mines at Chihuahua,
which belonged to a friend of mine, who informed me that
his mine yielded him $13.50 per cwt. I one day, with Robinson,
went through many of these furnaces and noticed the
manner which they pursued in analyzing the mineral and
extracting the metals; but, as I had previously asked several
Spanish officers to accompany me, who had always
declined or deferred it to a future period, I conceived it
probable it was too delicate a subject to make a minute
inquiry into. I, however, so far observed the process as to
learn that the mineral was brought from the mines in bags,
on mules, to the furnace; it was then ground or pounded
into small lumps, not more than the size of a nut, and precipitated
into water, in a sieve which permitted the smaller
particles to escape into a tub, through several progressive
operations. From the small particles which remained at the
bottom of the tubs, after it had been purified of the earthy
qualities, there was a proportion of metal extracted by a
nicer process; but the larger parts were put into a furnace
similar to our iron furnaces, and when the mass was in a
state of fusion, it was let out into a bed of sand prepared
for it, which formed it into bars about the size of our common
pig iron, averaged in value at about $2,500. The gold
was cast into a mold similar to a bowl and stamped with its
value, as was each bar of silver, by the king's assayer of
metals. They were worth from $8,000 to $10,000. These
masses of silver and gold are received into the king's treasury
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_761" id="Page_761">761</a></span>
in payment, and in fact have a currency through the
kingdom; but there are vast speculations made on the coinage,
as people who have not large capital prefer selling their
bullion in the internal provinces, at a considerable discount,
to being obliged to transport it to Mexico, in order to have
it converted into specie. The present C[ommandant?], I
was informed, was engaged in this traffic, on which, from
the province of Senora, he sometimes made 25 per cent.
Numbers of the proprietors who have no immediate use for
their bullion put it into their cellars, where it remains piled
up for their posterity, of no service to themselves or the
community.</p>

<p>There are at Chihuahua and in its vicinity 15 mines, 13
silver, one gold, and one copper, the furnaces of all of which
are situated round the town and suburbs, and present, except
on Sundays, volumes of smoke arising to the eye in every
direction, which can be seen from a distance long before
the spires of the city strike the view. It is incredible the
quantity of cinders which surround the city in piles 10 or 15
feet high; next the creek they have formed a bank of it to
check the encroachments of the stream, and it presents an
effectual barrier. I am told that an European employed
some hands and wrought at the cinders, which yielded $1.25
for each per day; but that this not answering his expectations,
he ceased his proceedings.</p>

<p>At Mausseme [Mapimi] there are one gold and seven silver
mines. At Durango there are many rich mines, but the
number to me is unknown. There are also gold mines in
the Sierra Madre, near Alomas [Alamos], and many others
of which I have no knowledge. There is in the province,
about 100 miles south of Chihuahua, a mountain or hill of
loadstone. Walker, who had been on the ground and surveyed
it, informed me it appeared to be in solid strata, as
regular as those of limestone, or any other of the species.
He had brought home a square piece of near a foot and a
half, was preparing some to be sent to Spain, and likewise
forming magnets to accompany it, in order that their comparative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_762" id="Page_762">762</a></span>
strength might be ascertained with magnets formed
in Europe.</p>

<p><i>Rivers.</i><a name="FNanchor_IVP-33" id="FNanchor_IVP-33" href="#Footnote_IVP-33" class="fnanchor">[IV'-33]</a> Rio Conchos is the largest in the province. It
takes its source in the Sierra Madre, near Batopilis, in lat.
28° N., and discharges itself into the Rio del Norte [at the
Presidio del Norte] in lat. 31°, after a course of about 300
miles. It is the largest western branch of the Rio del Norte,
and receives in its course the Rio Florido from the east and
San Paubla [now San Pedro] from the west. Where we
struck the Conchos, it appeared to be nearly as large as the
Rio del Norte at the Passo.</p>

<p>The Rio San Paubla is the largest western branch of the
Conchos; it heads in lat. 28° 50´ N., and empties into the
latter at Bakinoa[?]. Its whole course is about 150 miles;
in summer it is nearly dry, and in the rainy seasons impassable.</p>

<p>The Rio Florido takes its rise in lat. 26° 30´ N., and after
a course of about 150 miles discharges into the Conchos.
Guaxequillo is situated on its east bank, about its center.</p>

<p>The Rio Nassas [Nasas] is in part the line between Biscay
and Cogquilla; it runs north and sinks in the lake du Cayman
[Laguna del Muerto]; it is nearly dry in the dry seasons,
but at some seasons it is impassable.</p>

<p><i>Lakes.</i> Lac du Cayman and lac du Parras are two small
lakes situated at the foot of the mountains [in the Bolson
de Mapimi], and are full of fish.</p>

<p><i>Animals, Insects, etc.</i> There are some few bears, deer,
and wild horses, but they are not in abundance. The scorpions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_763" id="Page_763">763</a></span>
of Durango are one of the most remarkable instances
of the physical effects of climate or air that I ever saw
recorded. They come out of the walls and crevices in May,
and continue about a fortnight in such numbers that the
inhabitants never walk in their houses after dark without a
light, and always shift or examine the bed-clothes and beat
the curtains previous to going to bed; after which the curtains
are secured under the bed, similar to the precautions
we take with our mosquito curtains. The bite of those
scorpions has been known to prove mortal in two hours.
The most extraordinary circumstance is that by taking them
10 leagues from Durango they become perfectly harmless
and lose all their venomous qualities. Query: Does it
arise from a change of air, sustenance, or what other cause?<a name="FNanchor_IVP-34" id="FNanchor_IVP-34" href="#Footnote_IVP-34" class="fnanchor">[IV'-34]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_764" id="Page_764">764</a></span></p>

<p><i>Population and Chief Towns.</i> The population of Biscay
may be estimated at 200,000: of these three-twentieths may
be Spaniards from Europe, five-twentieths Creoles, five-twentieths
Metifs and Quatroons, and seven-twentieths
Indians. Durango [or Guadiana] was founded in 1550. It
is the principal city, the seat of government for the province
of Biscay and of the bishopric of Durango. Its population
may be estimated at 40,000 souls. It is situated in lat. 25°
N. and long. 107° W.</p>

<p>Pallalein, situated somewhere at the foot of the Sierra
Madria [Madre], is supposed to contain 25,000 souls.</p>

<p>Chihuahua,<a name="FNanchor_IVP-35" id="FNanchor_IVP-35" href="#Footnote_IVP-35" class="fnanchor">[IV'-35]</a> the place of residence of the commandant-general
of the internal provinces, was founded in 1691; it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_765" id="Page_765">765</a></span>
is situated in lat. 29° N., long. 107° 30´ W. Its population
may be estimated at 7,000. It is an oblong square, on the
east side of a small stream which discharges into the river
Conchos. On its south extremity is a small but elegant
church. In the public square stands the principal church,
royal treasury, town-house, and the richest shops. At the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_766" id="Page_766">766</a></span>
western extremity is another church for the military, a
superb hospital belonging formerly to the Jesuits' possessions,
the church of the monks of St. Francis, St. Domingo,
the military academy, and quartel del tropa. On the northwest
were two or three missions, very handsomely situated
on a small stream which comes in from the west. About
one mile to the south of the town is a large aqueduct which
conveys the water round it, to the east, into the main stream
below the town, in the center of which is raised a reservoir
for the water, whence it is to be conducted by pipes to the
different parts of the city, and in the public square is to be
a fountain and <i>jet d'eau</i>, which will be both ornamental and
useful. The principal church at Chihuahua was the most
superb building we saw in New Spain. Its whole front was
covered with statues of the apostles and the different saints,
set in niches of the wall, and the windows, doors, etc., were
ornamented with sculpture. I never was within the doors,
but was informed by Robinson that the decorations were
immensely rich. Some men, whom we supposed entitled to
credit, informed us that the church was built by a tax of
12½ cents laid on each ingot of gold or silver taken out of
the mines in the vicinity in [blank] years. Its cost, with
decorations, was $1,500,000, and when it was finished there
remained $300,000 of the fund unappropriated. At the
south side of Chihuahua is the public walk, formed by three
rows of trees whose branches nearly entwine over the heads
of the passengers below. At different distances there are
seats for persons to repose on. At each end of the walks
there were circular seats, on which, in the evening, the
company collected and amused themselves with the guitar,
and songs in Spanish, Italian, and French, adapted to the
voluptuous manners of the country. In this city, as well as
all others of any consideration, there are patrols of soldiers
during the night, who stop every person at nine o'clock
and examine them. My countersign was "Americans."</p>

<p><i>Trade, Commerce, and Manufactures.</i> Biscay trades with
North Mexico, Senora, and the viceroyalty, from the latter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_767" id="Page_767">767</a></span>
of which places they bring on mules all their dry goods,
European furniture, books, ammunition, etc. They furnish
a great quantity of horses, mules, sheep, beeves, and goats,
to the parts of the kingdom which are more populous and
have less spare ground for pasturage, etc. Some persons
make large fortunes by being carriers from Mexico to Chihuahua,
the freight being $8 per cwt., and they generally putting
300 pounds on each mule. The merchants make their
remittances twice a year in bullion. Goods sell at Chihuahua
at about 200 per cent, on the prices of our Atlantic seaport
towns. Their horses average at $6, but some have sold
as high as $100; their trained mules at $20, but extraordinary
matches for carriages have sold at $400 per pair. Rice
sells at $4 per cwt. They manufacture some few arms,
blankets, stamped leather, embroidery, coarse cotton and
woolen cloths, and a species of rough carpeting. Their
blankets average $2, but some sell as high as $25.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture.</i> They cultivate wheat, corn, rice, oats, cotton,
flax, indigo, and vines. What I have said relative to
the cultivation of those articles in New Mexico will equally
apply to this province; but it may be proper to observe
here that one of Nolan's men constructed the first cotton-gin
they ever had in the province, and that Walker had
caused a few churns to be made for some private families,
and taught them the use of them.</p>

<p><i>Timber, Plains, and Soil.</i> To the north of Chihuahua,
about 30 miles to the right of the main road, there is some
pine timber; at a spring on this side of Carracal [Carrizal] we
saw one walnut tree, and on all the small streams there are
shrubby cotton trees. With these few exceptions the whole
province is a naked, barren plain, which presents to the eye
an arid, unproductive soil, more especially in the neighborhood
of mines; even the herbage appears to be poisoned by
the mineral qualities of the soil.</p>

<p><i>Antiquities.</i> There are none in the province which came
within my notice but the Jesuits' college and church at Chihuahua,
which were about a century old, and used as hospitals.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_768" id="Page_768">768</a></span>
In these there was nothing peculiar, except a certain
solidity and strength, in which they appeared to surpass the
other public buildings of the city.</p>

<p><i>Aborigines.</i> There are no uncivilized savages in this
province except the Appaches, of whom I have spoken
largely. The Christian Indians are so incorporated amongst
the lower grades of Metifs that it is scarcely possible to
draw the line of distinction, except at the ranchos of noblemen
or large landholders, where they are in a state of vassalage
[peonage]. This class of people laid a conspiracy, which
was so well concerted as to baffle the inquiries of the
Spaniards for a length of time, and to occasion them the loss
of several hundred inhabitants. The Indians used to go out
from their villages in small parties; in a short time a part
would return with the report that they had been attacked by
the Indians; the Spaniards would immediately send out a
detachment in pursuit, when they were led into an ambuscade
and every soul cut off. They pursued this course so
long that the whole province became alarmed at the rapid
manner in which their enemies multiplied; but some circumstances
leading to suspicion, they made use of the superstition
of those people for their ruin. Some officers disguised
themselves like friars and went round amongst the
Indians, pretending to be possessed of the spirit of prophecy.
They preached up to the Indians that the day was
approaching when a general delivery from Spanish tyranny
was about to take place, and invited the Indians to join in
concerting with them the work of God. The poor creatures
came forward, and in their confessions stated the great hand
that had already been put to the work. After these pretended
friars had ascertained the nature and extent of the
conspiracy, and had a body of troops prepared, they commenced
the execution and put to death about 400 of the
unsuspecting Indians. This struck terror and dismay
through the Indian villages, and they dared not rise to
declare their freedom and independence.</p>

<p><i>Government and Laws.</i> In this province there is some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_769" id="Page_769">769</a></span>
shadow of civil law; but it is merely a shadow, as the following
anecdote may illustrate: An officer, on arriving at
a village, demanded quarters for himself and troops. The
supreme civil officer sent him word that he must show his
passport. The military officer immediately sent a file of
men, who brought the judge a prisoner before him, when
he severely reprimanded the judge for his insolence and
obliged him to obey his orders instantly. This was done
by a subaltern, in a city of 20,000 inhabitants. The only
laws which can be said to be in force are the military
and ecclesiastic, between which there is a perfect understanding.</p>

<p>The governor is a brigadier-general, resides at Durango,
and receives $5,000 in addition to his pay in the line. It is
proper to observe that there are ordinances to bear on each
subject of civil discussion; but the administration of them
is so corrupt that the influence of family and fortune generally
procures the determination that they have right on
their side.</p>

<p>In each town is a public magazine for provisions, to which
every farmer brings whatever grain and produce he may
have for sale, and where he is sure to find a market; and
should there be a scarcity the ensuing year, it is retailed out
to the inhabitants at a reasonable rate. To this place all
the citizens of the town repair to purchase.</p>

<p><i>Morals, Manners, etc.</i> There is nothing peculiar in the
manners or morals of the people of this province, but a
much greater degree of luxury among the rich, misery
among the poor, and a corruption of morals more general
than in New Mexico. As to military spirit, they have none.
At a muster of a regiment of militia at Chihuahua one of my
men attended, and informed me that there were about 25
who had fire-arms and lances, 50 with bows and arrows and
lances, and the balance with lances or bows and arrows only.</p>

<p><i>Military Force.</i> The regular military force of Biscay consists
of 1,100 dragoons, distributed as follows: On the
frontiers of the deserts of New Mexico and Senora, at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_770" id="Page_770">770</a></span>
forts of Elisiaira [Elizario], Carracal [Carrizal], San Buenaventura,
Presidio del Norte, Janos, Tulenos, and San Juan
Baptist [Bautista]. Farther south are Chihuahua, Jeronime
[Jeronimo or Hieronimo], Cayone, San Paubla [Pablo],
Guaxequillo [Guajuquilla], and Conchos, with several other
places which are appendages of those positions. The complement
of each of those posts is 150 men, but may be averaged
at 1,100 in all, say 100 at each post. The militia are
not worthy of particular notice.</p>

<p><i>Religion.</i> Biscay is in the diocese of Durango, the bishop's
salary being estimated at $100,000 per annum. The catholic
religion is here in its full force, but the inferior clergy
are very much dissatisfied. The people's superstition is so
great that they run after the holy father in the streets, endeavoring
to kiss the hem of his garment; and should the
bishop be passing the street, the rich and poor all kneel.</p>

<p><i>History.</i> I shall not presume to say anything on this
subject, except that I believe this province has been populated
about 270 years.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Senora.</span> <i>Geography.</i> The province of Senora lies between
lat. 33° and 27° N., and long. 110° and 117° W. Its
greatest length from north to south is about 420 miles, and
its width from east to west 380 miles. It is bounded north
by New Mexico, west by California, south by Sinaloa and
the gulf, east by Biscay and New Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_IVP-36" id="FNanchor_IVP-36" href="#Footnote_IVP-36" class="fnanchor">[IV'-36]</a></p>

<p><i>Air and Climate.</i> Dry, pure, and healthy generally, but
near the gulf the ground is marshy, and it is, in some of the
districts, unhealthy.</p>

<p><i>Mines, Minerals, and Fossils.</i> On this subject I can only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_771" id="Page_771">771</a></span>
speak in general. Senora abounds in rich gold and silver
mines, but more especially the former, inasmuch as gold
does not preserve its usual exchange with silver in this
province. General Salcedo told me that in this province
the largest piece of pure gold had been found ever yet discovered
in New Spain, and that it had been sent to the
king to be put in his cabinet of curiosities.</p>

<p><i>Rivers.</i><a name="FNanchor_IVP-37" id="FNanchor_IVP-37" href="#Footnote_IVP-37" class="fnanchor">[IV'-37]</a> Rio de l'Ascencion is a short river which enters
the Gulf of California about 31° N. lat. Rio Yaqui heads
on the borders of Biscay and Senora, and discharges into
the Gulf of California in Guyamas [Guaymas], lat. 23° N.</p>

<p><i>Timber, Plains, and Soil.</i> This province is, like Biscay,
destitute of timber, but has some rich soil near the gulf.</p>

<p><i>Animals.</i> There are deer, cabrie, and bear; there are
also remarkably large lizards [<i>Ctenosaura teres</i> of Harlan],
which are said to weigh ten pounds; these are perfectly
harmless, tamed by the inhabitants, and trained to catch
mice.</p>

<p><i>Population and Chief Towns.</i> The population of Senora
may be estimated at 200,000 souls, of which three-twentieths
probably are Spaniards, four-twentieths Creoles, six-twentieths
Metifs, and seven-twentieths Indians.</p>

<p>Arispea [Arizpe<a name="FNanchor_IVP-38" id="FNanchor_IVP-38" href="#Footnote_IVP-38" class="fnanchor">[IV'-38]</a>], the capital of Senora, and until 20
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_772" id="Page_772">772</a></span>
years past the seat of government of the internal provinces,
is situated in lat. 31° N. and long. 111° W., near the head
of the river Yaqui. It is celebrated throughout the kingdom
for the urbanity and hospitality of its inhabitants,
and the vast quantity of gold table utensils made use of
in their houses. Its population is 3,400 souls. Sonora
and Terenate are the next cities in magnitude in the province,
the latter to the north and the former to the south of
the capital.</p>

<p><i>Trade and Commerce.</i> Senora trades with New Mexico
and Biscay for the productions of those different provinces,
and with Old Mexico both by land and sea, through the
gulf of California. It is celebrated for its cheese, horses,
and sheep.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture.</i> They cultivate the same as in Biscay.</p>

<p><i>Aborigines.</i> There are a number of savage nations bordering
on Senora, which obliges the king to keep up a
number of military posts on the north and west frontiers;
but the names of the tribes, or any of their distinguishing
characters, I am unacquainted with. However, it may not
be improper to observe that they are armed with bows,
arrows, shields, and lances, like their savage neighbors.
The civilized Indians are in the same situations as in the
other provinces.</p>

<p><i>Government and Laws.</i> Similar to Biscay, the governor
being a brigadier-general and receives $7,000 in addition
to his pay in the line.</p>

<p><i>Morals and Manners.</i> In every respect similar to Biscay,
except that they are more celebrated for hospitality.</p>

<p><i>Military Force.</i> The regular military force of this province
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_773" id="Page_773">773</a></span>
is 900 dragoons and 200 infantry, stationed as follows:
Tubson, San Cruz, Tubac, and Altac on the north, with 100
dragoons each for a garrison; Fiuntenas, Bacuachi, Bavista,
and Horcasites in the center, with 300 dragoons and 200
infantry; Buenavista on the south, with 100 dragoons as a
garrison.<a name="FNanchor_IVP-39" id="FNanchor_IVP-39" href="#Footnote_IVP-39" class="fnanchor">[IV'-39]</a> The infantry mentioned above are of a nation
of Indians called the Opejas, and are said to be the best
soldiers in New Spain. I saw a detachment of them at
Chihuahua who appeared to be fine, stout, athletic men,
and were the most subordinate and faithful troops I ever
knew, acting like a band of brothers and having the greatest
attachment for their officers.</p>

<p><i>Religion.</i> Catholic, in the diocese of the bishop of
Durango.</p>

<p><i>History.</i> I am unacquainted with it, except that the seat
of government of the internal provinces was formerly at
Arispea, at which time the government of California was
also under the commandant-generalcy of the internal
provinces; but the removal of the seat of government to
Chihuahua and the disjunct situation of California induced
his Majesty to annex it to the government of the viceroyalty.
The increasing magnitude of the relations of
New Spain with the United States also gave an importance
to the eastern interests which induced the continuance of
the seat of government at Chihuahua.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Sinaloa.</span> <i>Geography.</i> The province of Sinaloa lies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_774" id="Page_774">774</a></span>
between lat. 23° and 28° N., and long. 108° and 111° W.
It is bounded north by Senora and Biscay, east by the
latter, south by the administration of Guadalaxara, and
west by the gulf of California; in its greatest length it is
300 miles north and south, and in width from east to west
150 miles.<a name="FNanchor_IVP-40" id="FNanchor_IVP-40" href="#Footnote_IVP-40" class="fnanchor">[IV'-40]</a></p>

<p><i>Air and Climate.</i> On the sea-coast humid, but back [of
the coast] dry and pure.</p>

<p><i>Mines, Minerals, and Fossils.</i> There are both gold and
silver mines; but with their relative value or productions I
am unacquainted.</p>

<p><i>Rivers.</i><a name="FNanchor_IVP-41" id="FNanchor_IVP-41" href="#Footnote_IVP-41" class="fnanchor">[IV'-41]</a> Rio [del] Fuerte takes its source in lat. 27° N.
and long. 110° W., and disembogues into the gulf of California.
It crosses the whole province, and is nearly 150
miles long. Rio Culican [Culiacan] is not more than 50
miles in length, and enters the gulf of California in lat.
25° N.</p>

<p><i>Timber, Plains, and Soil.</i> No timber; soil similar to
that of Senora.</p>

<p><i>Animals.</i> Domestic only.</p>

<p><i>Population and Chief Towns.</i> Its population may be estimated
at 60,000, not more than three-twentieths of whom
are Spaniards; the remainder Creoles, Metifs, and Indians.</p>

<p>Sinaloa is the capital, but its population, extent, etc., to
me is unknown.</p>

<p><i>Trade and Commerce.</i> Unacquainted with.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_775" id="Page_775">775</a></span></p>

<p><i>Agriculture.</i> The same as Senora.</p>

<p><i>Aborigines.</i> None who are not civilized.</p>

<p><i>Government and Laws.</i> Unacquainted with.</p>

<p><i>Military Force.</i> One hundred dragoons for expresses, and
a guard for the governor.</p>

<p><i>Religion.</i> Catholic, in the diocese of the bishop of
Durango.</p>

<p><i>History.</i> To me unknown.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Cogquilla.</span> <i>Geography.</i> The province of Cogquilla
lies between lat. 31° and 33° 30´ N., and long. 101° and 105°
W. Its greatest length north and south may be 500 miles,
and its greatest width east and west 200 miles. It is
bounded north by New Mexico and Texas, east by the latter,
San Ander, and New Leon, south by the administration
of Zacataca, and west by Biscay.<a name="FNanchor_IVP-42" id="FNanchor_IVP-42" href="#Footnote_IVP-42" class="fnanchor">[IV'-42]</a></p>

<p><i>Air and Climate.</i> Pure and healthy, except about the
middle of May, when the heat is intense, and sometimes a
scorching wind is felt, like the flame issuing from an oven or
furnace, which frequently skins the face and affects the eyes.
This phenomenon is felt more sensibly about the setting of
the sun than at any other period of the 24 hours.</p>

<p><i>Mines, Minerals, and Fossils.</i> I know of no mines in this
province, except at Montelovez and San Rosa, with the
value of which I am unacquainted; but those of San Rosa
are reputed to be as rich as any silver mines in the kingdom.
Montelovez has none very considerable.</p>

<p><i>Rivers.</i> This province has no river of magnitude or consequence
but the Rio Grande, which crosses its northern
part in a S. E. direction.<a name="FNanchor_IVP-43" id="FNanchor_IVP-43" href="#Footnote_IVP-43" class="fnanchor">[IV'-43]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_776" id="Page_776">776</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lakes.</i> There is a small lake called the Aqua [Agua]
Verde, situated on its western extremities, which gives
rise to a small stream that discharges into the Rio del
Norte.</p>

<p><i>Timber, Plains, and Soil.</i> From the river Nassus [Nasas]
to the east there is the palmetto, which grows to the height
of 20 and 25 feet, with a trunk of 2 feet in diameter. Its
leaves are in the shape of a spear, and cover all the trunk
when young, but fall off as the tree grows old. Its wood is
of a spongy nature, and from every information I could procure,
is of the same species as that of the same name in the
Southern States.<a name="FNanchor_IVP-44" id="FNanchor_IVP-44" href="#Footnote_IVP-44" class="fnanchor">[IV'-44]</a> One hundred miles to the east of the
Rio Grande oak timber commences, being the first we saw
in the provinces; but it is very small and scrubby, and presents
from this to the line of Texas (the river Mariana
[Medina, near San Antonio, Tex.]), a very perceptible
gradation of the increase of timber, both in quantity, luxuriance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_777" id="Page_777">777</a></span>
and variety. The country here becomes very similar
to the Indiana territory.</p>

<p><i>Animals.</i> Deer, wild horses, a few buffalo and wild hogs
[peccaries].</p>

<p><i>Population and Chief Towns.</i> Montelovez [Monclova<a name="FNanchor_IVP-45" id="FNanchor_IVP-45" href="#Footnote_IVP-45" class="fnanchor">[IV'-45]</a>]
is the capital of Cogquilla. It is situated on a small stream
of water in lat. 26° 30´ N. and long. 103° 30´ W. It is about
one mile in length, on a course N. 70° E. by the main street.
It has two public squares, seven churches, a powder magazine,
mills, king's hospital, and quartel del tropa [soldiers'
barracks]. This is the principal military depot for the provinces
of Cogquilla and Texas. Its population may be estimated
at 3,500 souls. This city being the stated residence
of his Excellency Governor Cordero, he has ornamented it
with public walks, columns, and fountains, and made it one
of the handsomest cities in the internal provinces.</p>

<p>Santa Rosa, about 38 miles N. W. of Montelovez, is represented
to be the most healthy situation in the province,
and to have the best water and fruit. It is on the headwaters
of the river Millada [read here Sabinas]. Its population
is represented at 4,000 souls. Paras [Parras] is situated
on a small stream; with its suburbs it is supposed to contain
7,000 souls, and San Lorenzo, three miles to the north, 500
souls. This place may be termed the vineyard of Cogquilla,
the whole population pursuing no other occupation than the
cultivation of the grape. Its name denotes the Branches
of the Vine. At the Hacienda of San Lorenzo, where we
halted, there were 15 larger stills, larger cellars, and a greater
number of casks than I ever saw in any brewery of the
United States. Its gardens were delightfully interspersed
with figs, vines, apricots, and a variety of fruits which are
produced in the torrid zone; fine summer-houses, where
were wine, refreshments, and couches to repose on, and
where the singing of the birds was delightful. There were,
likewise, mills and a fine water-fall.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_778" id="Page_778">778</a></span></p>

<p>The Presidio [Salto] of Rio Grande is situated on that
river, and is remarkable for nothing but three or four handsome
missions with which it is surrounded, a powder magazine,
quarters for the troops, and a few iron field-pieces on
miserable truck carriages. Population 2,500 souls.</p>

<p>The population of this province may be estimated at
70,000 souls, not more than 10,000 of whom are Spaniards.</p>

<p><i>Trade, Commerce, and Manufactures.</i> This province
receives all its merchandise from Mexico by land, and in
return gives horses, mules, wines, gold, and silver. There
is an annual fair held at Saltelo [Saltillo], in New Leon
[Coahuila], where an immense quantity of merchandise is
disposed of, and where merchants of very large capitals
reside.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture.</i> They cultivate the vine principally, with
grain and corn sufficient for their own consumption, and to
supply the greatest part of Texas.</p>

<p><i>Aborigines.</i> The Appaches cover the northwest frontier.
The Lee Pawnees [Lipans: see <a href="#Footnote_IVP-27">note<sup>27</sup>, p. 746</a>] are
a nation who rove from the Rio Grande to some distance
into the province of Texas. Their former residence was on
the Rio Grande, near the sea-shore. They are at present
divided into three bands, of 300, 350, and 100 men each.
They are at war with the Tetaus and Appaches, and at
peace with the Spaniards. They have fair hair, and are
generally handsome, armed with bows, arrows, and lances.
They pursue the wild horses, of which they take numbers,
and sell them to the Spaniards.</p>

<p><i>Government and Laws.</i> Military and ecclesiastical power
is all that is known or acknowledged in this province; but
its administration was mild under their excellent Governor
Cordero. The governor's civil salary is $4,000 per annum.</p>

<p><i>Morals and Manners.</i> It was evident to the least discerning
eye that, as we diverged from these parts which produced
such vast quantities of the precious metals, the
inhabitants became more industrious, and there were
fewer beggars. Thus the morals of the people of Cogquilla
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_779" id="Page_779">779</a></span>
were less corrupt than those of Biscay or New Leon, their
neighbors.</p>

<p><i>Military Force.</i> There are 400 dragoons maintained in
this province, and stationed at Montelovez, San Rosa, Pres.
Rio del Norte, and San Fernandez.</p>

<p><i>Religion.</i> Catholic, but mild. It is in the diocese of
Durango.</p>

<p><i>History.</i> Cogquilla had not pushed its population as far
as the Rio Grande in the year 1687, as at that time La Salle<a name="FNanchor_IVP-46" id="FNanchor_IVP-46" href="#Footnote_IVP-46" class="fnanchor">[IV'-46]</a>
established himself at the entrance of that river, it being a
wilderness; but Montelovez was established some time
before this era. Of its particular history I have no
knowledge.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Texas.</span> <i>Geography.</i> The province of Texas lies between
lat. 27° 30´ and 35° N., and long. 98° and 104° W.,
bordered north by Louisiana, east by the territory of
Orleans, west by Cogquilla and New Mexico, and south by
New San Ander. Its greatest length from north to south
may be 500 miles, and breadth from east to west 350.</p>

<p><i>Air and Climate.</i> One of the most delightful temperatures
in the world; but, being a country covered with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_780" id="Page_780">780</a></span>
timber, the new emigrants are generally sickly, which may
justly be attributed to putrescent vegetation, which brings
on intermittent and bilious attacks, and, in some instances,
malignant fevers. The justice of these remarks is proved
by the observations of all the first settlers of our western
frontiers, that places which in the course of 10 or 15 years
become perfectly healthy, were the first two or three years
quite the reverse, and generally cost them the loss of two
or three members of their families.</p>

<p><i>Mines, Minerals, and Fossils.</i> The only one known and
worked is a mine of lead.</p>

<p><i>Rivers.</i><a name="FNanchor_IVP-47" id="FNanchor_IVP-47" href="#Footnote_IVP-47" class="fnanchor">[IV'-47]</a> The river St. Antonio takes its source about
one league to the northeast of the capital of the province,
St. Antonio, and is navigable for canoes to its source,
affording excellent fish, fine mill seats, and water to every
part of the town. It is joined from the west by the river
Mariana, which forms part of the line between Cogquilla
and Texas, and then discharges into the Rio Guadelupe
about 50 miles from the sea. At the town of St. Antonio
it is about 20 yards wide, and in some places 12 feet in
depth. The river Guadelupe takes its source about 150
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_781" id="Page_781">781</a></span>
miles to the northwest of St. Antonio; where we crossed it,
it was a beautiful stream, at least 60 yards in width. Its
waters are transparent and navigable for canoes. After
receiving the waters of the St. Antonio and St. Marco it
discharges into the southwest end of the bay of St. Bernardo
[Matagorda]. At the crossing of this river there is a
range for the horses of St. Antonio and a guarde de caballo,
with an elegant site for a town.</p>

<p>The river St. Marco takes its source about 100 miles
north, 20 west of St. Antonio, and at the crossing of the
road is 30 yards in width, a clear and navigable stream for
canoes. By the road this river is only 14 miles from the
Guadelupe, into which it discharges.</p>

<p>The Red [or Colorado] river [of Texas] takes its source
in the province of Cogquilla in lat. 33° N. and long. 104° 30´
W., but, bending to the east, enters the province of Texas,
and after a winding course of about 600 miles disembogues
into the bay of St. Bernard [Matagorda], in lat. 29° N.
Where the road traverses it, it is at least 150 yards wide,
and has a guard of dragoons stationed on its banks. Its
waters are of a reddish cast, whence it probably derived
its name. This stream is navigable for boats of three or
four tons burden.</p>

<p>The river Brassos [Brazos] takes its source in the province
of Cogquilla in lat. 34° N. and long. 105° W., enters
the province of Texas, and discharges into the gulf of
Mexico in lat. 28° 40´, after a course of 750 miles. It is the
largest river in the province, and, where the road crosses,
is 300 yards wide and navigable for large keels. From the
appearances on its banks it must rise and fall 100 feet. Its
waters were red and turbid; its banks well timbered, with a
rich, prolific soil. Here was kept the only boat I recollect
to have seen in the provinces.</p>

<p>The river Trinity takes its source in lat. 34° N. and long.
99° W., and discharges into Galueston's [Galveston] bay
in lat. 29° 30´ N. By its meanders it is about 300 miles
in length. Where the road crosses it is about 60 yards in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_782" id="Page_782">782</a></span>
width, with high, steep banks covered with timber, and a
rich, luxuriant soil.</p>

<p>The Nachez [Neches] and Angelina are small rivers, of
about 20 yards in width, which, after forming a junction,
discharge into the Trinity. The river Toyac is a small
stream, which discharges into the gulf of Mexico, at the
same bay with the Sabine, in about lat. 29° 50´ N. and long.
97° W.<a name="FNanchor_IVP-48" id="FNanchor_IVP-48" href="#Footnote_IVP-48" class="fnanchor">[IV'-48]</a></p>

<p>The Sabine river, the present limits between the Spanish
dominions and the territories of the United States in that
quarter, takes its source in about lat. 33° N., and enters
the gulf of Mexico in 29° 50´. It may be 300 miles in length
by its meanders, and at the road about 50 yards in width.
Here the Spaniards keep a guard and a ferry-boat.</p>

<p><i>Lakes.</i> Some small ones near the head of the Guadelupe
and some branches of Red river.</p>

<p><i>Timber, Plains, and Soil.</i> This province is well timbered
for 100 miles from the coast, but has some small prairies
interspersed through its timbered land; take it generally,
it is one of the richest, most prolific, and best watered
countries in North America.</p>

<p><i>Animals.</i> Buffalo, deer, elk, wild hogs [peccaries], and
wild horses, the latter of which are in such numbers as
to afford supplies for all the savages who border on the
province, the Spaniards, and vast droves for the other
provinces. They are also sent into the United States,
notwithstanding the trade is contraband. They go in such
large gangs that it is requisite to keep an advanced guard
of horsemen in order to frighten them away; for should
they be suffered to come near the horses and mules which
you drive with you, by their snorting, neighing, etc., they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_783" id="Page_783">783</a></span>
would alarm them, and frequently the domestic animals
would join them and go off, notwithstanding all the exertions
of the dragoons to prevent them. A gentleman
told me he saw 700 beasts carried off [stampeded] at one
time, not one of which was ever recovered. They also in
the night frequently carry off the droves of travelers' horses,
and even come within a few miles of St. Antonio, and take
off the horses in that vicinity.</p>

<p>The method pursued by the Spanish in taking them is as
follows: They take a few fleet horses and proceed into
the country where the wild horses are numerous. They
then build a large strong inclosure, with a door which
enters a smaller inclosure; from the entrance of the large
pen they project wings out into the prairie a great distance,
and then set up bushes, etc., to induce the horses,
when pursued, to enter into these wings. After these
preparations are made they keep a lookout for a small
drove, for, if they unfortunately should start too large a
one, they either burst open the pen or fill it up with dead
bodies, and the others run over them and escape; in which
case the party are obliged to leave the place, as the stench
arising from the putrid carcasses would be insupportable;
and, in addition to this, the pen would not receive others.
Should they, however, succeed in driving in a few, say two
or three hundred, they select the handsomest and youngest,
noose them, take them into the small inclosure, and then
turn out the remainder; after which, by starving, preventing
them taking any repose, and continually keeping them
in motion, they make them gentle by degrees, and finally
break them to submit to the saddle and bridle. For this
business I presume there is no nation in the world superior
to the Spaniards of Texas.</p>

<p><i>Population and Chief Towns.</i> St. Antonio, the capital of
the province, lies in lat. 29° 50´ N. and long. 101° W., and
is situated on the headwaters of the river of that name; it
contains perhaps 2,000 souls, most of whom reside in
miserable mud-wall houses, covered with thatched grass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_784" id="Page_784">784</a></span>
roofs. The town is laid out on a very grand plan. To the
east of it, on the other side of the river, is the station of
the troops.</p>

<p>About two, three, and four miles from St. Antonio are
three missions, formerly flourishing and prosperous. Those
buildings, for solidity, accommodation, and even majesty,
were surpassed by few that I saw in New Spain. The resident
priest treated us with the greatest hospitality, and was
respected and beloved by all who knew him. He made a
singular observation relative to the aborigines who had
formerly formed the population of those establishments
under charge of the monks. I asked him what had become
of the natives. He replied that it appeared to him that
they could not exist under the shadow of the whites, as the
nations who formed those missions had been nurtured,
taken all the care of that it was possible, and put on the same
footing as the Spaniards; yet, notwithstanding, they had
dwindled away until the other two missions had become
entirely depopulated, and the one where he resided had not
then more than sufficient to perform his household labor;
from this he had formed an idea that God never intended
them to form one people, but that they should always
remain distinct and separate.</p>

<p>Nacogdoches is merely a station for troops, and contains
nearly 500 souls. It is situated on a small stream of the
river Toyac.</p>

<p>The population of Texas may be estimated at 7,000.
These are principally Spanish, Creoles, some French, some
Americans, and a few civilized Indians and half-breeds.</p>

<p><i>Trade and Commerce.</i> This province trades with Mexico
by Mont El Rey and Montelovez for merchandise, and with
New Orleans by Nachitoches; but the latter trade, being
contraband, is liable to great danger and risks. They give
in return specie, horses, and mules.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture.</i> The American emigrants are introducing
some little spirit of agriculture near Nacogdoches and the
Trinity; but the oppressions and suspicions they labor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_785" id="Page_785">785</a></span>
under prevent their proceeding with that spirit which is
necessary to give success to the establishment of a new
country.</p>

<p><i>Aborigines.</i> The Tancards [<a href="#Footnote_IIIP-12">note<sup>12</sup>, p. 705</a>] are a nation
of Indians who rove on the banks of Red river, and are 600
men strong. They follow the buffalo and wild horses, and
carry on a trade with the Spaniards. They are armed with
the bow, arrow, and lance. They are erratic and confined to
no particular district; are a tall, handsome people; in conversation
they have a peculiar cluckling, express more by
signs than any savages I ever visited, and in fact language
appears to have made less progress. They complained
much of their situation and the treatment of the Spaniards;
are extremely poor, and, except the Appaches, were the
most independent Indians we encountered in the Spanish
territories. They possess large droves of horses.</p>

<p>There are a number of other nations now nearly extinct,
some of which are mentioned by Dr. Sibley in a report he
made to the government of the United States on these
subjects. A few, and very few indeed, of those nations
have been converted by the missions, and these are not in
that state of vassalage in which the Indians further to the
south are held. [<a href="#Footnote_IIIP-17">Notes<sup>17</sup></a>, <a href="#Footnote_IIIP-21"><sup>21</sup></a>, <a href="#Footnote_IIIP-22"><sup>22</sup></a>, pp. 709, 713, 714.]</p>

<p><i>Government and Laws.</i> Perfectly military, except as to
the ecclesiastical jurisdiction.</p>

<p><i>Morals and Manners.</i> They being on the frontier, where
buffalo and wild horses abound, and not engaged in any
war with savages who are powerful, have adopted a mode
of living by following those animals, which has been productive
of a more wandering disposition round the capital
(St. Antonio) than in any other of the provinces. Cordero,
restricting by edicts the buffalo hunts to certain seasons,
and obliging every man of family to cultivate so many
acres of land, has in some degree checked the spirit of
hunting or wandering life which had been hitherto so very
prevalent, and has endeavored to introduce, by his example
and precepts, a general urbanity and suavity of manners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_786" id="Page_786">786</a></span>
which rendered St. Antonio one of the most agreeable
places that we met with in the provinces.</p>

<p><i>Military Force.</i> There were in Texas at the time I came
through 988 [888?] men, from the actual returns of the
troops which I have seen, 500 of whom were from St.
Ander and New Leon, under command of governor Herrara.
The disposition of those troops is as follows: 388
at St. Antonio, 400 [300?] at the cantonment of [Blank, 300
marked on map low down] on the Trinity, 100 at the [crossing
of the] Trinity, and 100 at Nacogdoches. The militia,
a rabble made somewhat respectable by a few American
riflemen who are incorporated amongst them, are about 300
men, including bow and arrow men.</p>

<p><i>Religion.</i> Catholic, but much relaxed.</p>

<p><i>History.</i> To me unknown, except what can be extracted
from various authors on that subject.</p>

<p class="center p2">GENERAL REMARKS ON NEW SPAIN.</p>

<p>To become acquainted with all the civil and political
institutes of a country requires a perfect knowledge of the
language, a free ingress to the archives, and a residence of
some years; even then we can scarcely distinguish between
the statute laws and common law, derived from custom,
morals, and habits. Under those circumstances, it cannot
be expected that I shall be able to say much on the subject,
as I possessed none of the above advantages. I will, however,
offer a few observations. To a stranger it is impossible
to define the limits of the military and ecclesiastical
jurisdictions; in every affair which relates to the citizens,
and in fact with the soldiery, the force of superstition is
such that I am doubtful whether they would generally
obey one of their officers in a direct violation of the injunction
of their religious professions. The audiences of Mexico
and Guadalaxara were formed, no doubt, as a check on the
immense power of the viceroy. The number of members
composing each is to me unknown, but they are formed of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_787" id="Page_787">787</a></span>
the viceroy as president, with two votes, generals, and
bishops. To their jurisdictions the appeals from the judgment
of the intendants and all subordinate officers may be
made in civil cases; but the military and ecclesiastical
decisions are distinct. Notwithstanding all this semblance
of justice, should an individual dare to make the appeal
and not succeed in establishing the justice of his claim to
redress, he is certainly ruined. Where justice is so little
attended to, when opposed to power and wealth, as in the
Spanish provinces, the appeal is a desperate remedy. This
tribunal or legislative body enacts all the laws for the
general regulations of their divisions of the kingdom.</p>

<p>The captain-generalcy of the internal provinces appeared
to me to be much more despotic, for the laws or regulations
were issued in the form of an order merely, without any
kind of a preamble whatsoever, except sometimes he would
say, "By order of the king"; and such was the style of
governors of provinces.</p>

<p><i>Morals, Manners, etc.</i> For hospitality, generosity, and
sobriety the people of New Spain exceed any nation perhaps
on the globe; but in national energy, patriotism, enterprise
of character, or independence of soul, they are
perhaps the most deficient. Yet there are men who have
displayed bravery to a surprising degree, and the Europeans
who are there cherish with delight the idea of their gallant
ancestry.</p>

<p>Their women have black eyes and hair, fine teeth, and are
generally brunettes. I met but one exception to this rule,
at Chihuahua&mdash;a fair lady, who, by way of distinction, was
called "the girl with light hair." They are all inclining a
little to enbonpoint; but none or few are elegant figures.
Their dress generally is short jackets and petticoats and
high-heeled shoes, without any head-dress. Over the whole
dress they have a silk wrapper,<a name="FNanchor_IVP-49" id="FNanchor_IVP-49" href="#Footnote_IVP-49" class="fnanchor">[IV'-49]</a> which they always wear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_788" id="Page_788">788</a></span>
and, when in the presence of men, affect to bring over their
faces, but from under which you frequently see peeping a
large sparkling black eye. As we approached the Atlantic
and our frontiers, we saw several ladies who wore the gowns
of our countrywomen, which they conceived to be much
more elegant than their ancient costume. The lower class
of the men are generally dressed in broad-brimmed hats,
short coats, large waistcoats, and small clothes always open
at the knees (owing, as I suppose, to the greater freedom it
gives to the limbs on horseback), a kind of leather boot or
wrapper bound round the leg somewhat in the manner of
our frontier-men's leggings, and gartered on. The boot is
of a soft, pliable leather, but not colored. In the eastern
provinces the dragoons wear, over this wrapper or boot, a
sort of jack-boot made of sole-leather, to which are fastened,
by a rivet, the spurs, the gaffs of which are sometimes near
an inch in length; but the spurs of the gentlemen and officers,
although clumsy to our ideas, are frequently ornamented
with raised silver-work on the shoulders, and the
straps embroidered with silver and gold thread. They are
always ready to mount their horses, on which the inhabitants
of the internal provinces spend nearly half the day.
This description will apply generally to the dress of all the
men of the provinces for the lower class; but in their cities,
among the more fashionable, they dress after the European
or United States modes, with not more variation than we
see in our cities from one six months to another.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_789" id="Page_789">789</a></span></p>

<p>Both men and women have remarkably fine hair, and
pride themselves in the display of it. Their amusements
are music, singing, dancing, and gambling. The latter is
strictly prohibited, but the prohibition is not much attended
to. The dance of &mdash;&mdash; is danced by one man and two
women, who beat time to the music, which is soft and
voluptuous, but sometimes changing to a lively, gay air.
The dancers exhibit the motions of the soul by gestures of
the body, snapping the fingers, and sometimes meeting in
a stretched embrace. The fandango is danced to various
figures and numbers. The minuet is still danced by the
superior class only. The music made use of is the guitar,
violin, and singers, who, in the first-described dance, accompany
the music with their hands and voices, having
always some words adapted to the music.</p>

<p>Their games are cards, billiards, horse-racing, and cock-fighting,
the first and last of which are carried to the most
extravagant lengths, losing and winning immense sums.
The present commandant-general is very severe with his
officers in these respects, frequently sending them to some
frontier post in confinement for months, for no other fault
than having lost large sums at play. At every town of consequence
is a public walk, where the ladies and gentlemen
meet and sing songs, which are always on the subject of
love or the social board. The females have fine voices, and
sing in French, Italian, and Spanish, the whole company
joining in the chorus.</p>

<p>In their houses the ladies play the guitar, and generally
accompany it with their voices. They either sit down on
the carpet cross-legged, or loll on a sofa. To sit upright in
a chair appeared to put them to great inconvenience; although
the better class would sometimes do it on our first
introduction, they soon took the liberty of following their
old habits. In their eating and drinking they are remarkably
temperate. Early in the morning you receive a dish
of chocolate and a cake; at twelve you dine on several
dishes of meat, fowls, and fish, after which you have a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_790" id="Page_790">790</a></span>
variety of confections, and indeed an elegant dessert; then
drink a few glasses of wine, sing a few songs, and retire to
take the siesta, or afternoon's nap, which is taken by rich
and poor. About two o'clock the windows and doors are
all closed, the streets deserted, and the stillness of midnight
reigns throughout. About four o'clock they rise, wash and
dress, and prepare for the dissipation of the night. About
eleven o'clock some refreshments are offered, but few take
any, except a little wine and water and candied sugar.</p>

<p>The government has multiplied the difficulties of Europeans
intermarrying with the Creoles or Metifs to such a
degree that it is difficult for such a marriage to take place.
An officer wishing to marry a lady not from Europe is
obliged to acquire certificates of the purity of her descent
200 years back, and transmit it to the court, when the
license will be returned; but should she be the daughter of
a man of the rank of captain or upward this nicety vanishes,
as rank purifies the blood of the descendants.</p>

<p>The general subjects of conversations among the men are
women, money, and horses, which appear to be the only
objects, in their estimation, worthy of consideration. Uniting
the female sex with their money and their beasts, and
having treated them too much after the manner of the
latter, they have eradicated from their breasts every sentiment
of virtue or ambition, either to pursue the acquirements
which would make them amiable companions, instructive
mothers, or respectable members of society; their
whole souls, with a few exceptions, being, like those of
Turkish ladies, taken up in music, dress, and the little
blandishments of voluptuous dissipation. Finding that the
men only regard them as objects of gratification to the sensual
passions, they have lost every idea of that feast of
reason and flow of soul which arise from the intercourse of
two refined and virtuous minds.</p>

<p>The beggars of the City of Mexico are estimated at
60,000 souls; what must be the number through the whole
kingdom, and to what reason can it be owing that, in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_791" id="Page_791">791</a></span>
country superior to any in the world for riches in gold and
silver, producing all the necessaries of life and most of its
luxuries, there should be such a vast proportion of the inhabitants
in want of bread or clothing? It can only be
accounted for by the tyranny of the government and the
luxuries of the rich. The government strives, by all the
restrictions possible to be invented without absolutely
driving the people to desperation, to keep Spanish America
dependent on Europe.</p>

<p><i>Trade, Commerce, Manufactures, and Revenue.</i> The trade
and commerce of New Spain are carried on with Europe and
the United States by the port of Vera Cruz solely, and with
the East Indies and South America generally by Acapulco;
and, even at these ports, under such restriction as to productions,
manufactures, and time, as to render it of little
consequence to the general prosperity of the country. Were
all the numerous bays and harbors of the gulfs of Mexico
and California opened to the trade of the world, and a general
license given to the cultivation of all the productions
of which the country is capable, with freedom of exportation
and importation, with proper duties on foreign goods, the
country would immediately become rich and powerful, and
a proper stimulus would be held out to the poor to labor,
when certain of finding a quick and ready sale for the productions
of their plantations or manufactories. The country
abounds in iron ore, yet all the iron and steel, and
articles of manufactures, are obliged to be brought from
Europe, the manufacturing or working of iron being strictly
prohibited. This occasions the necessary articles of husbandry,
arms, and tools to be enormously high, and is a
great check to agriculture, improvements in manufactures,
and military skill. The works of the Mexicans, in gold,
silver, and painting, show them naturally to have a genius
which, with cultivation and improvement, might rival the
greatest masters of either ancient or modern times. Their
dispositions and habits are peculiarly calculated for sedentary
employments, and I have no doubt, if proper establishments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_792" id="Page_792">792</a></span>
were made, they would soon rival, if not surpass, the
most extensive woolen, cotton, or silk manufactures of
Europe; their climate being proper to raise the finest cotton
in the world, and their sheep possessing all the fineness of
wool for which they are so celebrated in Spain. Under
these circumstances, together with the immense quantities
of the raw materials which they have on hand, wool sells
for a mere trifle; and, in fact, they scarcely take half from
the fleece of the sheep, for the coarse manufactures of the
country and to make beds.</p>

<p>I cannot presume to state the revenues of the country
from official documents, but the following statements I have
had from so respectable a source, and they are so confirmed
by my own observations, that I think much reliance may be
placed on their correctness. The mint coins, per annum, at
least, $50,000,000 in silver and $14,000,000 in gold, the one-fifth
of which (the duty) is equal to $12,800,000.<a name="FNanchor_IVP-50" id="FNanchor_IVP-50" href="#Footnote_IVP-50" class="fnanchor">[IV'-50]</a> The
duties on foreign goods and the amount paid by the purchasers
of monopolies may be estimated at $4,000,000;
which, with the duty on gold and silver, makes the annual
revenue $16,800,000. The civil list of the kingdom is
$580,000, the military $7,189,200; these together amount
to $7,760,200, which, deducted from the gross revenue
of $16,700,000, leaves a clear revenue for the king from
his Mexican dominions of $9,030,800. The money paid
for the support of the clergy is not included in this
estimate, as they receive their revenue through its own
proper channel. The best paid officers under the government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_793" id="Page_793">793</a></span>
cost the king nothing in a direct line, yet the oppressive
manner in which they pay themselves and impoverish
the people would render it better policy to abolish their
impositions and pay them out of the public treasury by
a direct salary.</p>

<p class="p2">The European troops are some of the choicest regiments
from Spain; consequently, we may put them on the supposition
that they are well disciplined, and officered by men
of honor and science.</p>

<p>The regular troops of the kingdom who are in the viceroyalty,
acting from the stimulant of ambition and envy, are
supposed to be equal to their brethren from Europe. The
militia, with the regular officers, are likewise good troops,
but are not held in so high estimation as the other corps.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_794" id="Page_794">794</a></span>
Those three corps, forming a body of 23,288 men, may be
called the regular force of the kingdom, as the militia of
139,500 would, in my estimation, be of no more consequence
against the regular troops of any civilized power than the
ancient aborigines of the country were against the army
of Cortes.</p>

<p>The particular observations which follow must be considered
as applying to the troops of the internal provinces,
unless it is stated to the contrary.</p>

<p>The appearance of the Spanish troops is certainly, at a distance,
à la militaire; their lances are fixed to the side of the
saddle under the left thigh and slant about five feet above
the horse. On the right the carabine is slung in a case to
the front of the saddle, or pommel, crosswise, the breech to
the right hand; and on each side of the saddle, behind the
rider, is a pistol; below the breech of the carabine is slung
the shield, which is made of sole leather three doubled,
sewed together with thongs, with a band on the inside to
slip the left arm through; those of the privates are round,
and are about two feet in diameter. The officers and non-commissioned
officers have their shields oval, bending on
both sides, in order to permit the arrow to glance, and they
have in general the arms of Spain with Don Carlos IV. gilt on
the outside, with various other devices, which add much to
the elegance of their appearance on horseback, but are only
calculated to be of service against savages who have no fire-arms.
The dragoons of the viceroyalty do not make use of
the lance or shield, but are armed, equipped, and clothed
after the modern manner, as are also the dragoons of the
eastern provinces. When they recently expected to be
opposed to the American troops they were deprived of
the lance and shield, and received the straight cutlass in
their stead.</p>

<p>Their dress is a short blue coat, with red cape and cuffs,
without facings, leather or blue cotton velvet small-clothes
and waistcoat, the small-clothes always open at the knees,
the wrapping-boot with the jack-boot and permanent spur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_795" id="Page_795">795</a></span>
over it, a broad-brimmed, high-crowned wool hat, with a ribbon
round it of various colors, generally received as a present
from some female, which they wear as a badge of the favor
of the fair sex and a mark of their gallantry.</p>

<p>Their horses are small and slender-limbed, but very active
and capable of enduring great fatigue. The equipments of
the horses are, to our idea, awkward; but I believe them
superior to the English, and they have the advantage over
us in the skill of the rider, as well as in the quality of the
beast. Their bridles have a strong curb, which gives so
great a mechanical force to the bridle that I believe it almost
practicable with it to break the jaw of the beast. The saddle
is made after the Persian mode, with a high projecting
pommel or, as anciently termed, bow, and is likewise raised
behind. This is merely the tree; it is then covered by two
or three covers of carved leather and embroidered workmanship,
some with gold and silver in a very superb manner.
The stirrups are of wood closed in front, carved generally
into the figure of a lion's head, or that of some other beast;
they are very heavy, and to us present a very clumsy appearance.
The horseman, seated on his horse, has a small
bag tied behind him, his blankets either under him, or lying
with his cloak between his body and the bow, which makes
him at his ease. Thus mounted, it is impossible for the
most vicious horse ever to dismount them. They will catch
another horse with a noose and hair rope, when both are
running nearly at full speed, with which they soon choke
down the beast of which they are in pursuit; in short, they
are probably the most expert horsemen in the world.</p>

<p>At each post is a store, called the king's, where it was the
original intention of the government that the soldiers should
be supplied with provisions, clothing, arms, etc., at a cheap
rate; but it being a post generally given to some young
officer to make his fortune, they are subject to great impositions.
When a dragoon joins the service he receives from
the king five horses and two mules, and this number he is
always obliged to keep good from his own pocket; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_796" id="Page_796">796</a></span>
when he is discharged, the horses and mules receive the discharge
mark and become his private property. They engage
for five or ten years, at the option of the soldier, but in the
bounty there is a very material difference. It is extremely
easy to keep up their corps, as a private dragoon considers
himself upon an equality with most of the citizens and infinitely
superior to the lower class, and not unfrequently you
see men of considerable fortune marrying the daughters of
sergeants and corporals.</p>

<p>The pay of the troops of New Spain varies with the
locality, but may be averaged, in the internal provinces, as
follows:</p>

<p>Colonel, $4,500; lieutenant-colonel, $4,000; major, $3,000;
captain, $2,400; first lieutenant, $1,500; second lieutenant,
$1,000; ensign, $800; sergeant, $350; corporal, $300; private,
$288. With this pay they find their own clothes, provisions,
arms, accouterments, etc., after the first equipments.</p>

<p>Corporal punishment is contrary to the Spanish ordinances.
They punish by imprisonment, putting in the
stocks, and death. As a remarkable instance of the discipline
and regularity of conduct of those provincial troops,
although marching with them and doing duty as it were for
nearly four months, I never saw a man receive a blow or put
under confinement for one hour. How impossible would it
be to regulate the turbulent dispositions of the Americans
with such treatment! In making the foregoing remark I do
not include officers, for I saw more rigorous treatment exercised
toward some of them than was ever practiced in
our army.</p>

<p>The discipline of their troops is very different from ours.
As to tactics or military maneuvers, they are not held in
much estimation; for, during the whole of the time I was in
the country, I never saw a corps of troops exercising as dragoons,
but frequently marching by platoons, sections, etc.,
in garrison, where they serve as infantry with their carabines.
In these maneuvers they are very deficient. On a march a
detachment of cavalry generally encamp in a circle. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_797" id="Page_797">797</a></span>
relieve their guards at night; as soon as they halt the new
guard is formed on foot with their carabines, and then
marched before the commandant's tent, where the commanding
officer of the guard invokes the holy virgin three times;
the commanding officer replies, "It is well." They then
retire and mount their horses, and are told off, some to act
as guard of the horses, as cavalry, others as guard of the
camp, as infantry. The old guards are then paraded and
relieved, and the new sentinels take post. Their sentinels
are singing half the time, and it is no uncommon thing for
them to quit their post to come to the fire, go for water,
etc.&mdash;in fact, after the officer is in bed, frequently the whole
guard comes in; yet I never knew any man punished for
those breaches of military duty. Their mode of attack is
by squadrons, on the different flanks of their enemies, but
without regularity or concert, shouting, hallooing, and firing
their carabines; after which, if they think themselves equal
to the enemy, they charge with a pistol and then a lance.
From my observation on their discipline I have no hesitation
in declaring that I would not be afraid to march over a
plain with 500 infantry and a proportionate allowance of
horse artillery of the United States army, in the presence of
5,000 of these dragoons. Yet I do not presume to say that
an army with that inferiority of numbers would do to oppose
them, for they would cut off your supplies, and harass
your march and camp, night and day, to such a degree as
to oblige you in the end to surrender to them without ever
having come to action. If, however, the event depended on
one single engagement, it would eventuate with glory to the
American arms. The conclusion must not be drawn that I
consider they are more deficient in physical firmness than
other nations, for we see the savages, 500 of whom on a
plain fly before 50 bayonets, on other occasions brave danger
and death in its most horrid shapes, with an undaunted
fortitude never surpassed by the most disciplined and hardy
veterans. It arises solely from the want of discipline and
confidence in each other, as is always the case with undisciplined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_798" id="Page_798">798</a></span>
corps, unless stimulated by the godlike sentiment of
love of country, of which these poor fellows know little. The
traveling food of the dragoons in New Mexico consists of a
very excellent species of wheat biscuit, and shaved meat well
dried [charqui], with a vast quantity of red pepper [chile
colorado], of which they make bouilli and then pour it on
their broken biscuit, when the latter becomes soft and excellent
eating.</p>

<p>Farther south they use large quantities of parched corn-meal
and sugar [pinole], as practiced by our hunters, each
dragoon having a small bag. In short, they live, when on
command, on an allowance which our troops would conceive
little better than starving, never, except at night, attempting
to eat anything like a meal, but biting a piece of biscuit,
or drinking some parched meal with sugar and water, during
the day.</p>

<p>From the physical as well as moral properties of the
inhabitants of New Spain, I do believe they are capable of
being made the best troops in the world, possessing sobriety,
enterprise, great physical force, docility, and a conception
equally quick and penetrating.</p>

<p>The mode of promotion in the internal provinces is
singular, but probably productive of good effects. Should
a vacancy of first lieutenant offer in a company, the captain
commanding nominates, with the senior second lieutenant,
who by seniority would fill the vacancy, two other lieutenants
to the general, giving his comments on all three.
The general selects two for a nomination to the court, from
whom is selected the fortunate candidate, whose commission
is made out and forwarded. As the letters of nomination
are always kept a secret, it is impossible for the young
officers to say who is to blame if they are disappointed,
and the fortunate one is in a direct way to thank the king
only for the ultimate decision. And thus with superior
grades to the colonel.</p>

<p>The king of Spain's ordinances for the government of his
army are generally founded on justice and a high sense of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_799" id="Page_799">799</a></span>
honor. I could not get a set from any of the officers to
take to my quarters, consequently my observations on
them were extremely cursory. They provide that no old
soldier shall ever be discharged the service, unless for
infamous crimes. When a man has served with reputation
for 15 years and continues, his pay is augmented; 20 years,
he receives another augmentation; 27 years, he receives the
brevet rank and pay of an ensign; and 32, a lieutenant, etc.
Those circumstances are a great stimulant, although not
one in a thousand arrives at the third period, when they
are permitted to retire from the service with full pay and
emoluments. All sons of captains, or of grades superior,
are entitled to enter the king's schools as cadets, at the age
of 12 years.</p>

<p>The property of any officer or soldier who is killed on
the field of battle, or dies of his wounds, is not liable to
be taken for debt, and is secured, as well as the king's
pension, to the relatives of the deceased.</p>

<p>Courts-martial for the trial of commissioned officers must
be formed of general officers; but this clause subjects the
officers of the provinces to a great species of tyranny, for
the commanding general has taken it upon himself to
punish for all offenses not capital, and consequently according
to his own judgment and prejudices, from which there
is only an appeal to the king, and difficult it is indeed for
the complaints of a subaltern to reach his majesty through
the numerous crowd of sycophants who surround him, one-half
of whom are probably in league with his oppressor. It
likewise deprives an officer of the most sacred of all
rights, that of being tried by his peers; for, should he be
sent to Mexico or Europe for trial, it is possible he cannot
take half the testimony which is necessary to complete his
justification.</p>

<p>There is another principle defined by the ordinances,
which has often been the cause of disputes in the service
of the United States. The commandant of a post in the
Spanish service, if barely a captain, receives no orders from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_800" id="Page_800">800</a></span>
a general, should one arrive at his post, unless that general
should be superior in authority to the person who posted
him; for, says the ordinance, he is responsible to the king
alone for his post. That principle, according to my ideas,
is very injurious to the country which adopts it. For
example, we will say that a post of great importance, containing
immense military stores, is likely to fall into the
hands of the enemy; an officer superior to the commandant
receives the information, repairs to the post, and orders him
immediately to evacuate it. The commandant, feeling
himself only responsible to the authority who placed him
in that position, refuses to obey, and the magazines and
place are lost. The principle is also subversive of the very
root of military subordination and discipline, where an inferior
should in all cases obey a superior, who alone should
be responsible for the effect arising from the execution of
his orders. It will readily be believed that, in my thus
advocating implicit obedience to the orders of a superior,
that I do not suppose the highest improbabilities or impossibilities,
such as an order to turn your arms against the
constituted authority of your country, or to be the ensign
of his tyranny or the pander of his vices. Those are cases
where a man's reason must alone direct him, and are not&mdash;indeed,
cannot be&mdash;subject to any human rule whatever.</p>

<p><i>Religion.</i> It forms a subject with which I am very imperfectly
acquainted; but, having made some inquiries and
observations on the religion of the country, I will freely
communicate them, fearful at the same time that I lay
myself open to the severe criticism of persons who have in
any degree applied themselves to the study of theology or
the ritual of the catholic church.</p>

<p>The kingdom of New Spain is divided into four archbishoprics,
viz.: Mexico, Guadalaxara, Durango, and St. Louis
Potosi. Under these again are the sub-bishoprics&mdash;deacons,
curates, etc., all of whom are subject and accountable to
their immediate chief for the districts committed to their
charge, and the whole are again subject to the ordinances of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_801" id="Page_801">801</a></span>
the high court of inquisition held at the capital of Mexico,
whence are fulminated the edicts of their censure against the
heresies and impious doctrines of modern philosophy, both
as to politics and religion. I am credibly informed that the
influence of that tribunal is greater in his Catholic majesty's
Mexican dominions than in any Catholic country in Europe
or perhaps in the world. A few years since they condemned
a man to the flames, for asserting and maintaining some
doctrine which they deemed heretical; and a Jew who was
imprudent enough to take the image of Christ on a cross,
and put it under the sill of his door, saying privately he
would make the dogs walk over their God. They likewise
examine and condemn to the flames all books of a
modern sentiment, either as to religion or politics, and
excommunicate anyone in whose hands they may be found.
I recollect to have seen a decree of theirs published in the
Mexican gazettes, condemning a number of books, "as
heretical and contrary to the sacred principles of the holy
Catholic church, and the peace and durability of the government
of his Catholic majesty." Amongst these were mentioned
Helvetius on Man, J. J. Rousseau's works, Voltaire's,
Mirabeau's, and a number of others of that description;
even at so great a distance as Chihuahua a officer dared not
take Pope's Essay on Man to his quarters, but used to come
to mine to read it.</p>

<p>The salaries of the archbishops are superior to those of
any officers in the kingdom; the bishop of Mexico's being
estimated at $150,000 per annum, when the viceroy's is
$80,000, with $50,000 allowed for his table, falling short
of the bishop's $20,000.</p>

<p>Those incomes are raised entirely from the people, who
pay no tax to the king, but give one-tenth of their yearly
income to the clergy, besides the fees of confessions, bulls,
burials, baptisms, marriages, and a thousand impositions
which the corruption of priestcraft has introduced, and
which have been kept up by their superstition and ignorance.
Notwithstanding all this, the inferior clergy, who do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_802" id="Page_802">802</a></span>
all the slavery of the office, are liberal and well-informed
men; I scarcely saw one who was not in favor of a change
of government. They are generally Creoles by birth, and
always kept in subordinate grades, without the least shadow
of a probability of rising to the superior dignities of the
church. This has soured their minds to such a degree
that I am confident in asserting that they will lead the van
whenever the standard of independence is raised in that
country.</p>

<p><i>Politics.</i> It has often been a subject of discussion with
politicians, in what manner a mother country should treat
her distant and powerful colonies, in order to retain them
longest in their subjection; for the history of all nations
and all ages has proved that no community of people
separated from another by an immense ocean, feeling their
power, strength, and independence, will remain long subject
to the mother country, purely from the ties of consanguinity
and similarity of habits, manners, and religion. Society
itself having arisen from the mutual wants, fears, and
imbecility of the infancy of human institutions, a large
body of that society will remain no longer subject to
another branch, at the immense distance of 1,000 leagues,
than until they feel their maturity, and capability of providing
for their own wants and their own defense. Therefore
we may draw a conclusion that no political course of
conduct whatever will eventually prevent the separation;
but there is a line of conduct which certainly must retard
it in a great measure; and prudence would dictate to the
mother country the policy of giving way without a struggle
to an event beyond her power to prevent.</p>

<p>The two great examples of English and Spanish America
are before our eyes. England gave us liberty to pursue
the dictates of our own judgment with respect to trade,
education, and manners, by which means we increased in
power, learning, and wealth, with a rapidity unknown in the
annals of the world, and at the first attempt to infringe
the rights which we had hitherto enjoyed, asserted that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_803" id="Page_803">803</a></span>
claim which nature and the locality of our situation gave
us a right to demand and a power to defend. Had Great
Britain yielded to the storm with grace and dignity, she
would have secured our gratitude, ancient prejudices, and
affections in her favor; on the contrary, by a long and
arduous conflict, the murder of thousands of our citizens,
the destruction of our country, the profanation of our altars,
and the violation of every right, divine and human, she
implanted in the breast of the Americans an antipathy
approaching nearly to horror, a desire of revenge almost
hereditary; and destroyed the bonds of brotherhood which
might have subsisted between the two countries. It will
take ages of just conduct from her to the United States to
eradicate this. Spain pursued a different line of conduct
toward her Mexican dominions, which were settled by
Europeans 60 years previous to any part of the United
States, and might be termed a conquered kingdom, rather
than the settlement of a savage country. This country she
has therefore bound up in all the ligatures of restrictions,
monopolies, prohibitions, seclusions, and superstitions; and
has so carefully secluded all light from bursting in on their
ignorance, that they have vegetated like the acorns in the
forest, until the towering branches have broken through
the darkness of the wild which surrounded them and let
in the light of heaven. The approximation of the United
States, with the gigantic strides of French ambition, have
begun to arouse their dormant qualities, and to call into
action the powers of their minds on the subject of their
political situation.</p>

<p>An instance of their disposition for independence has
been exhibited in their feeble attempts at a revolution on
the 15th of January, 1624, under the viceroyalty of Don
Diego Carrello Galves; the insurrection on the 8th of June,
1692; and more recently, in 1797, under the Count de
Galves,<a name="FNanchor_IVP-51" id="FNanchor_IVP-51" href="#Footnote_IVP-51" class="fnanchor">[IV'-51]</a> when they proclaimed him king of Mexico in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_804" id="Page_804">804</a></span>
streets of the capital, and 130,000 souls were heard proclaiming,
"Long live Galvez, king of Mexico!" It was
then only for him to have willed it, and the kingdom of
Mexico was lost to Charles IV. forever. But preferring his
loyalty to his ambition, he rode out attended by his guards
to the mob, with sword in hand, crying out, "Long live his
Catholic majesty, Charles IV.," and threatening to put to
instant death with his own hand any persons who refused
immediately to retire to their houses. This dispersed the
people. In another quarter of the kingdom an immense
number had also collected and proclaimed him king. He
sent 10,000 men against them, dispersed them, and had four
beheaded. Those firm measures saved the country at that
period, and for them he received the greatest honors from
the court of Spain; but was poisoned a short time after, fulfilling
the maxim that "it is dangerous to serve a jealous
tyrant." For such always conceive that the same power
which stilled the ocean's rage can by its will raise the storm
into all the majesty of overwhelming fury. Thus, by taking
his life, it relieved them from the dread of his influence
with the Mexicans.</p>

<p>England would naturally have been the power they would
have looked up to, in order to form an alliance to secure
their independence; but the insatiable avarice and hauteur
exhibited by the English in their late descents at La Plate
[La Plata, in South America], with the disgrace of their
arms, has turned their views from that nation.</p>

<p>They therefore have turned their eyes toward the United
States, as to a sister of the same soil, in their vicinity&mdash;one
who has within her power ample resources of arms, ammunition,
and even men, to assist in securing their independence,
and who in that event would secure to herself the
almost exclusive trade of the richest country in the world for
centuries, and [the opportunity] to be her carriers as long
as the two nations exist. For Mexico, like China, will never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_805" id="Page_805">805</a></span>
become a nation of mariners, but will receive the ships of
all the world into her ports, and give her bullion in exchange
for the productions of their different countries. Then, what
would not be the advantages the United States would reap
from the event! Our numerous vessels would fill every
port, and our vicinity would enable us to carry off at least
nine-tenths of her commerce; even on the coast of the
Pacific no European nation could vie with us. There
would also be a brisk inland trade carried on with the
Spanish provinces via Red river; and having a free entrance
into all their ports, we should become their factors,
agents, guardians&mdash;in short, their tutelar genius; as they
fear but hate France and all French men and measures. It
therefore remains for the government of the United States
to decide whether, if Bonaparte should seize the crown of
Spain, the States would hold out a helping hand to emancipate
another portion of the western hemisphere from the
bonds of European tyranny and oppression: or, by a different
policy, suffer 6,000,000 people to become, in the hands of
French intrigue, enterprise, and tactics, a scourge on our
southwestern boundaries, which would oblige us to keep up
a large and respectable military force, and continually lay
us liable to a war on the weakest and most vulnerable part
of our frontiers.</p>

<p>Twenty thousand auxiliaries from the United States
under good officers, joined to the independents of the
country, are at any time sufficient to create and effect the
revolution. These troops can be raised and officered in the
United States, but paid and supplied at the expense of
Mexico. It would be requisite that not only the general
commanding, but that every officer, down to the youngest
ensign, should be impressed with the necessity of supporting
a strict discipline, to prevent marauding, which should
in some instances be punished with death, in order to
convince the citizens that we come as their friends and
protectors, not as their plunderers and tyrants. Also, the
most sacred regard should be paid not to injure the institutions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_806" id="Page_806">806</a></span>
of their religion; thereby showing them we have
a proper respect for all things in any way connected with
the worship of the Deity, at the same time that we permit
every man to adore him agreeably to the dictates of his
own judgment.</p>

<p>The details requisite for the equipment, organization, etc.,
of the corps, so as to adapt it to the locality of the country
and the nature of the service, could be easily formed, but
would be impertinent here.</p>

<p>Should an army of Americans ever march into the
country, and be guided and governed by these maxims,
they will only have to march from province to province in
triumph, and be hailed by the united voices of grateful
millions as their deliverers and saviors, whilst our national
character resounds to the most distant nations of the earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>On the arrival of your troops at my encampment, last
month, under the command of Lieutenant Don Ignacio
Saltelo and Mr. Bartholomew, they informed me that your
Excellency had directed them to assure me that I should be
escorted through your dominions to the source of Red
river, as our being on the frontiers of your province gave
cause to suspicion. I conceived it more proper to comply
with the request and repair to Santa Fe, in order to explain
to your Excellency any circumstance which might appear
extraordinary; but on my arrival here I am informed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_808" id="Page_808">808</a></span>
your Excellency that it is necessary for myself and troops
to pass by Chihuahua in the province of Biscay, more than
200 leagues out of my route. I have demanded of your
Excellency to know if we are to be considered as prisoners
of war. You inform me that you do not consider us in that
light. Not to embarrass your Excellency with many demands,
I only request to receive it from under your hand,
in what manner I am to consider myself, and the orders for
my passing into the country; also, whether the expense
of the voyage is to be considered as defrayed by the government
of Spain or of the United States. Excuse my language,
as I am not much accustomed to writing in French,
but your Excellency's having no person who understands
English obliges me to attempt that language.</p>

<p>The first lieutenant of the Anglo-American troops, of the
name of Z. Montgomery Pike, with the party of soldiers
under his command, having been met with by the troops
under my orders, at four days' journey from the seat of
government, in this province, which is under my charge, he
was required personally to appear, which he voluntarily
did; and, complying with the orders of the commanding-general
of these internal provinces, I bade the said lieutenant
proceed on his march, with his party, equipped with
horses, provisions, and equipage, under the charge of an
officer and 60 men of our troops, with orders to introduce
him to the said commanding-general in the town of
Chihuahua.</p>

<p>I permitted said party to carry their arms and ammunition,
being actuated by proper consideration, and in order
to grant said Anglo-American's petition.</p>

<p>I certify the foregoing contents to be accurate.</p>

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">St. Fernandez</span>, March 7th, 1807.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>On my arrival at this village, and meeting with Dr. Robinson,
he informed me he had acknowledged to Lieutenant
Malgares to belong to my party. As this acknowledgment,
in fact, only interested himself, I am constrained to explain
to your Excellency my reasons for having denied his connection
with me. He marched from St. Louis with my
detachment as a volunteer, after having with much pain and
solicitation obtained permission from the general for that
purpose. On our arrival on the Rio del Norte, then supposed
to be Red river, he left the party in order to come to
Santa Fe, with a view of obtaining information as to trade,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_810" id="Page_810">810</a></span>
and collecting some debts due to persons in the Illinois. On
my being informed of his embarrassments, I conceived it
would be adding to them to acknowledge his having accompanied
a military party to the frontiers of the province, and
conceived myself bound in honor and friendship to conceal
it; but his scorning any longer the disguise he assumed has
left me at liberty to make this acknowledgment to your Excellency,
which I hope will sufficiently exculpate me in the
opinion of every man of honor, and of the world, for having
denied a fact when I conceived the safety of a friend, in a
foreign country, was concerned in the event.</p>

<p>The above statement will be corroborated by General
Wilkinson, and he will be reclaimed by the United States as
a citizen, agreeably to our treaties with Spain regulating the
intercourse, commerce, etc., between the two nations.</p>

<p>I felt disposed to enter into an expostulation with your
Excellency, as to the deception practiced on me by the
officers who came out with your invitation to enter the province;
but will omit it, and only request that my sergeant
and party may be ordered to follow with all possible dispatch,
as he has all my astronomical instruments, and clothing,
except what I now wear.</p>

<p>I have found Lieutenant Malgares to be what you stated,
a gentleman and a soldier, and I sincerely wish the fortune
of war may one day enable me to show the gentlemen of the
Spanish army with whom I have had the honor of forming
an acquaintance, with what gratitude I appreciate their
friendship and politeness, and none more highly than your
Excellency's.</p>

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">Chihuahua</span>, April 4th, 1807.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I hope your Excellency may not attribute it to presumption
or a disposition to intrude, when I address you on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_811" id="Page_811">811</a></span>
subject foreign to my official duties, and on which I can only
speak as an individual; for I should feel myself wanting in
humanity, and that attention which every man owes to his
fellow-creatures in distress, should I remain silent, more
especially when those who are compatriots, and some of
them former companions, are now in a strange country, languishing
out their days far from their friends and relations,
with scarcely a dawn of hope remaining of ever again being
blessed with a view of their native homes. It is scarcely necessary
to add that I allude to the unfortunate companions
of [Captain Philip] Nolan, who, having entered the territories
of his Catholic Majesty in a clandestine manner,
equally in violation of the treaties between the two governments,
the laws of the United States, and those of Spain,
could not be reclaimed or noticed by their own country.
Yet, from every information I have received on the subject,
the men of the party were innocent, believing that Nolan
had passports from the Spanish governor to carry on the
traffic of horses. I pretend not to justify the many irregularities
of their conduct since [they have been] in the Spanish
dominions; but hope that these may be viewed with an
eye of clemency, as the men are most of them very illiterate,
possessing scarcely any part of an education.</p>

<p>David Fero was formerly a subaltern in a company of
infantry of the United States commanded by my father at
the time I served as a volunteer, but left the service, as I
have been informed, owing to some irregularities of conduct.
His having been once my companion entitles him at present
to my particular attention; yet I will here mention to your
Excellency a circumstance which may appear, if known, in
an unfavorable light, viz.: About 15 days past I was informed
Fero was in town, and that he desired to see me. I
was extremely mortified at receiving the information, as I
conceived he must have left his post in a clandestine
manner; yet I could not find it in my heart to refuse
the interview, which I gave, but determined at the same
time to inform you of the circumstance, conceiving that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_812" id="Page_812">812</a></span>
you could not look on it as a matter of much criminality.
[<a href="#Footnote_IIP-11">Note <sup>11</sup>, p. 660</a>.]</p>

<p>But to conclude, I have to beg of your Excellency, if it be
in your power and consistent with the line of conduct you
conceive proper to pursue, to inform me if anything can be
done toward restoring these poor fellows to their liberty,
friends, and country; and in a particular manner I intercede
for Fero. If it is out of the power of the general to grant
them leave to return to the United States, I beg to know if
there be any objection to my taking letters to their fathers,
wives, etc. I should not have addressed this letter to
the general, had I not conceived the fate of those men to
be at his disposal, as he had suffered one of them to join
the service of his Catholic Majesty; neither do I request
the honor of any other than a verbal reply, as I write in
the character of an individual, not as an officer of the
United States.</p>

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">Chihuahua</span>, April 8th, 1807.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Excellent Sir</span>:</p>

<p>On the 16th of February last, John Robinson appeared
before the governor of New Mexico, saying that he was
a Frenchman, an inhabitant of St. Louis, which place he
left on the 15th of June last year, with the view of going to
the country of the Pananas [Pawnees], to make recoveries
[of certain debts]; that, having received information that
his debtors had directed their steps to said province [of
New Mexico], he had concluded to follow them, in company
with 15 other persons, who went for the purpose of
hunting on the rivers of Arcs,<a name="FNanchor_VP-3" id="FNanchor_VP-3" href="#Footnote_VP-3" class="fnanchor">[V'-3]</a> Arkansaw, and Colorado
(Red river); that in the neighboring mountains of the two
last [named rivers] his company had left him, for which
reason he saw himself under the necessity of proceeding to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_816" id="Page_816">816</a></span>
the Yutas Indians [Utes], to whom he exposed his situation,
and who accordingly agreed to conduct him [to Santa Fé].</p>

<p>On the 25th of the same month of February, at the distance
of four days' march from the town of Santa Fe, and
nine leagues west of its settlement, at the place called the
Ojocaliente (Hot Spring), near the confluence of Rio Grande
del Norte (Great North river), and that known under the
name River [Rio] de los Conejos ([River] of Rabbits), a detachment
of the garrison of said province of New Mexico
met Montgomery Pike, first lieutenant of the infantry of the
United States, with eight men of the said infantry; who, on
being given to understand that he must be conducted to
said town, consented to accompany them. It was then
settled that two of his [Pike's] men should remain on the
spot with half of his Catholic Majesty's detachment, to wait
for six others [of Pike's men] who had not yet arrived;
while he proceeded to the governor's, to whom he declared
that his being in that neighborhood was owing solely to his
having been lost, and having mistaken the Rio del Norte
for the Colorado. But this [Spanish] officer, in compliance
with the orders of his superior officer, forwarded the said
first lieutenant [Pike], with the six men of the American army
and the above mentioned John Robinson, to this capital.</p>

<p>They arrived here on the 2d instant, and said officer
[Pike], on being presented to me, laid before me, in the
same manner as he had done to the governor of Santa Fe,
the papers relative to his mission, the correspondence he
had carried on with your Excellency since it commenced,
his journals, and note books.</p>

<p>Your Excellency is not ignorant of the repeated representations
made by the king's minister in the United
States, and by the Marquis of Cassa Calva while he was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_817" id="Page_817">817</a></span>
Louisiana, summoning<a name="FNanchor_VP-4" id="FNanchor_VP-4" href="#Footnote_VP-4" class="fnanchor">[V'-4]</a> the American government to carry
into effect any projects of extending its expeditions into
territories unquestionably belonging to his Majesty. You
must therefore, without any further observations or remarks
on my part, be satisfied that the documents contain evident,
unequivocal proofs that an offense of magnitude has been
committed against his Majesty, and that every individual of
this party ought to have been considered as prisoners on
the very spot. Notwithstanding such substantial and well-grounded
motives as would have warranted such a measure,
also wishing to give the widest latitude to the subsisting
system of harmony and good understanding, and, above all,
being finally persuaded that your Excellency would take such
steps as your judgment might suggest as best calculated
to prevent any bad consequences on the occasion, I have
concluded to keep in this general government all the papers
presented by Lieutenant Pike, and to give him and his
men full liberty to return to your Excellency, after having
treated them with attention, and offered them every assistance
they stood in need of.</p>

<p>I am, without reserve, and beyond expression, your most
obedient, humble, respectful, and faithful servant, who
prayeth God may preserve your Excellency many years.</p>

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">Chihuahua</span>, April 14th, 1807.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>On my marching from Santa Fe, Governor Allencaster
informed me that my papers would be considered as a
sacred deposit until my arrival at this place, when your
Excellency would examine and take them into consideration.</p>

<p>When they were examined and taken possession of, I
explained without disguise the nature and contents of each,
conceiving that those only which had any relation to the
object of my expedition could be interesting, and that
merely a copy of the chart and a translation of the official
papers would be taken. You must be conscious, Sir, that it
was in my power to have secreted or destroyed every trace
of my voyage and plans previous to my arrival at Chihuahua;
but, resting satisfied that no rupture had taken place
between his Catholic Majesty and the States I have the
honor to serve, which would have been a justification for
the seizure of my papers, I preferred leaving them <i>in statu
quo</i>, to using that duplicity which in some degree always
implicates the character of a military man.</p>

<p>Admitting the country which I explored to be contested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_821" id="Page_821">821</a></span>
between the two governments, each would naturally wish to
gain some information as to its geographical situation, in
order that they might each form correct ideas as to what
would be their mutual interests, founded on justice and the
honor and dignity of the nation, in forming the line of
demarcation. This was the view of the United States government
in the expedition which I had the honor to command;
the loss of the geographical sketches taken might be
the occasion of a suspension of the final line of limits, and
consequently the delay of an amicable adjustment of the
differences now existing between the two governments.</p>

<p>Your Excellency may not have an intention of detaining
my papers, which I had begun to suppose from your returning
only part of them by Lieutenant Walker; in which case
you will please to excuse this intrusion. But I will add
that, if you have it in view to detain the papers, I request
you will be pleased to examine them with particular care.
You will find that there are letters from General Wilkinson,
as well as his son, to me; also, from the latter to his father
and mother; and others which, being by no means of a
political nature, or at least not relative to the relations existing
between the government of Spain and the United States,
therefore can by no means be interesting to your Excellency.
The book which contains my charts also contains part of
the blotters of a voyage to the source of the Mississippi,
which I presume cannot be interesting to the Spanish government.</p>

<p>But, to conclude, I have only to request of your Excellency
to know if it is your intention to detain my papers
now in your possession; and if so, that you may cause me
to be furnished, or suffer me to take, a copy of them, and
that I may receive a certificate from under your hand of
the number, nature, etc., of the said papers, and the reasons
for their seizure and detention, in order that my government
may be enabled to make the proper application to the
Spanish court for an explanation. My reason for applying
to your Excellency so early on this subject is that, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_822" id="Page_822">822</a></span>
arrival of my men who are still in the rear, I may be prepared
to march in a short period of time; for, under the
present aspect of affairs, I feel conscious that I am as anxious
to arrive on the territories of the United States as your
Excellency must be for me to quit the dominions of his
Catholic Majesty.</p>

<p>In all events, I hope you will believe me to be, with the
highest sentiments of personal respect,</p>

pp. 53-55.)</i></h3>

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">Chihuahua</span>, April 20th, 1807.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear General</span>:</p>

<p>Never did I sit down to address you with a heart so
oppressed with anxiety and mortification; but knowing the
uncertainty which must exist as to the fate of myself and
party, I conceive it proper to attempt a communication,
although I think it extremely uncertain, owing to the
difficulty of the route, whether it may ever come to hand,
or at least, previous to my arrival at the territories of the
United States, owing to the various circumstances which
are not to be communicated in a letter. I was detained in
the mountains of Mexico [<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, present State of Colorado]
until the month of January, and in February found myself
with eight of my party only, on the head branches of the
Rio [Grande] del Norte, which I then conceived to be the
sources of the Red river, our information making the latter
extend the whole distance between the former and the
Arkansaw, although its sources are some hundred miles
below either of the others.</p>

<p>Here I was encountered by two officers and 100 men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_823" id="Page_823">823</a></span>
who bore orders from the governor of New Mexico to
cause me and my party to march to the capital of said
province. His request was in the most polite style, and in
fact the commanding officer assured me there was not the
least constraint, but that his Excellency desired a conference,
and that I should be conducted by the most direct
route to the navigable part of the Red river, whence I could
immediately descend to Nachitoches. Although dubious of
the faith of the invitation, and in a situation where I could
have defended myself as long as my provision lasted, or
until I might probably have escaped in the night; yet,
knowing the pacific intentions of our government, and the
particular instructions of my general as to my conduct in
case of a rencounter with a body of Spanish troops, I
conceived it most proper to comply with the demand and
repair to Santa Fe; and, as the balance of my party who
remained in the mountains were, many of them, invalids
and not in a situation to be able to return, I conceived it
most proper to leave orders for them to follow, accompanied
by an escort of Spanish troops left for that purpose.</p>

<p>On my arrival in Santa Fe, his Excellency Governor
Allencaster informed me it was necessary that I should
immediately march to Chihuahua, Province of Biscay, in
order to present myself to his Excellency, Commandant-general
N. Salcedo, for further orders. This being so different
from what I had been taught to expect, I demanded of
Governor Allencaster, in a written communication, to know
if I were to consider myself and party as prisoners of war.
He replied in the negative. We marched on the following
day, and arrived on the 2d instant at this place, whence, I
am informed by the general, I shall march, on the arrival of
the remainder of my party, for Nachitoches.</p>

<p>I must here acknowledge myself and party under infinite
obligations to the friendship and politeness of all the Spanish
officers, and in a particular manner to the commandant-general
of those provinces.</p>

<p>Should the politics of our country make it necessary to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_824" id="Page_824">824</a></span>
augment the army previous to my arrival, I hope the
general will approve of my aspiring to a considerable promotion
in the new corps. Should the line of demarcation
be amicably adjusted between the United States and Spain,
I hope to obtain the appointment of one of the commissioners,
as I make bold to assert that, with respect to the
arrangements necessary, and knowledge of the country
through which the line must pass, I am better instructed
than any other officer of my age in our service; and, if
joined to a colleague of profound astronomical knowledge,
we could surmount every difficulty. I likewise beg leave
to suggest to your Excellency that I conceive the information
I hold to be of considerable consequence in the determination
of the line of limits, and that if it be not already
determined I can throw considerable light on the subject.</p>

<p>I hope your Excellency will be pleased to forward orders
for me to Nachitoches, informing me if I am to descend to
[New] Orleans or proceed to the Federal City; and if the
latter, permitting me to pass by Louisiana, in order to visit
and arrange the affairs of my family, to whom I beg the
favor of my general to communicate the certainty of the
existence of myself and Dr. Robinson, who begs to be
sincerely remembered to you.</p>

<p>Please to present my respectful compliments to your lady;
and the doctor's and mine to James [Lieutenant Wilkinson],
who, I hope, has long ere this arrived in safety.</p>

<p>The general will pardon the requests I have made of him,
knowing the confidence of my heart in the paternal and
soldierly esteem which he has manifested for him who has
the honor to be,</p>

<p class="left25">
With every sentiment of esteem,<br />
<span class="i2">Respect, and high consideration,</span><br />

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">Chihuahua</span>, April 23d, 1807.</p>

<p>Of the papers connected with the expedition which by
orders of the United States government you have made
from the St. Louis of the Illinois unto the settlements of
New Mexico, and which you yourself<a name="FNanchor_ON-F" id="FNanchor_ON-F" href="#Footnote_ON-F" class="fnanchor">f</a> separated from
those [others] which you brought here and put into my
hands the day you arrived in this town, there have been
formed an inventory, and a certificate respecting each of
them accompanying it, to you, and in the office, the 17th
current, for the purpose therein expressed, the judgment on
which remains for the decision of the king, my lord, and shall
be reported in the secret archives of this captain-generalcy.
Meditating that you have indicated, in your official summons
to this government, the greatest desire to arrive at the territories
of the United States, [I] have resolved that you prepare
to continue your voyage in two or three days, in consequence
of which the arrangements necessary shall be made,
such as you, with the people of your expedition, have
experienced until your arrival at this place.</p>

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">New Orleans</span>, May 20th, 1807.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>After having counted you among the dead, I was most
agreeably surprised to find, by a letter from General Salcedo,
received a few days since, that you were in his
possession, and that he proposed sending you, with your
party, to our frontier post. I lament that you should lose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_826" id="Page_826">826</a></span>
your papers, but shall rely much on your memory. Although
it was unfortunate that you should have headed
Red river, and missed the object of your enterprise, yet
I promise myself that the route over which you have passed
will afford some interesting scenes, as well to the statesman
as the philosopher.</p>

<p>You will hear of the scenes in which I have been engaged,
and may be informed that the traitors whose infamous
designs against the constitution and government of our
country I have detected, exposed, and destroyed, are vainly
attempting to explain their own conduct by inculpating me.
Among other devices, they have asserted that your and
Lieutenant Wilkinson's enterprise was a premeditated
co-operation with [Aaron] Burr. Being on the wing for
Richmond, in Virginia, to confront the arch-traitor and his
host of advocates, I have not leisure to commune with
you as amply as I could desire. Let it then suffice for me
to say to you, that of the information you have acquired,
and the observations you have made, you must be cautious,
extremely cautious, how you breathe a word; because
publicity may excite a spirit of adventure adverse to the
interests of our government, or injurious to the maturation
of those plans which may hereafter be found necessary and
justifiable by the government.</p>

<p>I leave Colonel Cushing<a name="FNanchor_VP-6" id="FNanchor_VP-6" href="#Footnote_VP-6" class="fnanchor">[V'-6]</a> in command of the district,
with plenary powers, and have informed him that you have
leave to repair to St. Louis by the most direct route, the
moment you have communicated to me in duplicate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_827" id="Page_827">827</a></span>
result of your travels, voluntary and involuntary, in relation
to clime, country, population, arts, agriculture, routes,
distances, and military defense. The president will be
impatient to have whatever you have acquired; to the detailed
account a sketch must be added, and the original and
duplicate addressed to me at the city of Washington, with
the least possible delay. You may make up your report
at Natchitoches, and proceed thence to the Wascheta
[Washita] and thence to the Arkansaw, or you may descend
to Fort Adams, and proceed thence to St. Louis by the
most convenient route. Colonel Cushing, whom I leave in
command of the district, has my orders in your favor, and
will give you every indulgence; but as an expedition is now
in motion up the Arkansaw, to explore it to its source and
further northwest, it is highly important that you should,
either in person or by two or three confidential men, send
forward to the Arkansaw every information which you may
deem essential to the success of the enterprise. A Mr. Freemen
[Thomas Freeman], under the chief direction of Mr.
[William] Dunbar of Natchez, has control of this operation.
The escort, which consists of 35 select non-commissioned
officers and privates, is commanded by Lieutenant Wilkinson,
seconded by Lieutenant T[homas]. A. Smith. This
detachment, with two boats suitably equipped, will reach
Natchez in eight or ten days from the present, and will proceed
with all possible dispatch. You will address your
communications to Lieutenant Wilkinson, who, after many
hardships and difficulties, reached this place about the 1st
of March. He has finished a pretty good traverse of the
river, and his journal is interesting. I think the present
party will winter near the Arkansaw Osages, about 600
miles by the river from the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The president mentioned you and your explorations to
the source of the great river, in his address to Congress, in
handsome terms. I am convinced he has a proper sense of
your merits, and will do you ample justice. I offer you
leave to go immediately to your family, because I apprehend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_828" id="Page_828">828</a></span>
it will be most desirable; yet, if you possess in your
information aught which you may desire to communicate in
person, you are at liberty to proceed, by the shortest route,
to the seat of government, near which you will find me, if
alive, three or four months hence.</p>

<p>I pray you to attend particularly to the injunctions of
this hasty letter, and to believe me, whilst I am your
general,</p>

<p class="left45">

<h3><i>Art.  13. Letter, Pike to Wilkinson. (<a name="orig5-b" id="orig5-b">Orig. No. 5</a>, pp. 57-63.)</i></h3>

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">Nachitoches</span>, July 5th, 1807.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear General</span>:</p>

<p>Once more I address you from the land of freedom and
under the banners of our country. Your esteemed favor of
the 20th of May now lies before me, in which I recognize
the sentiments of my general and friend, and will endeavor,
as far as my limited abilities permit, to do justice to the
spirit of your instructions.</p>

<p>I must premise to your Excellency that my letter of the
20th of April, dated at Chihuahua, went through a perusal
by General Salcedo, previous to his forwarding it.</p>

<p>That letter stated the mode of my being brought into
Santa Fe, and I will now state to your Excellency the proceedings
on the subject of my papers. I will omit the hauteur
of the reception given me by Governor Allencaster, for
a more particular communication; it changed afterward to
extreme politeness. Being under no restrictions previous to
arriving at Santa Fe, I had secreted all my papers which I
conceived it necessary to preserve, leaving my book of
charts, my orders, and such others as should induce the
governor to know me in my proper character, and prevent
his suspicions being excited to a stricter inquiry.</p>

<p>On examining my commission, orders, etc., he told me to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_829" id="Page_829">829</a></span>
remove my trunk to my own quarters, and that on the morrow
he would converse with me on the subject. I had
caused my men to secrete my papers about their bodies, conceiving
this safer than [leaving them] in the baggage; but
in the evening, finding the ladies of Santa Fe were treating
them to wine, etc., I was apprehensive their intemperance
might discover the secret, and took them from all but one,
who had my journal in full, but who could not be found,
and put them in my trunk, conceiving that the inspection
was over. But next morning an officer, with two men,
waited on me and informed me that he had come for me to
visit the governor, and brought these two men to take up
my trunk. I immediately perceived I was outgeneraled.
On my arrival at the governor's house, his Excellency demanded
if I had the key. My reply was in the affirmative;
when he observed, "It is well"; my trunk should be a
sacred deposit in the charge of the officer who would escort
me to Chihuahua, for which place I marched after dinner,
under the escort of Lieutenant Don Facundo Malgares and
65 men. His character I beg leave to introduce to the
attention of your Excellency as that of a European possessing
all the high sense of honor which formerly so evidently
distinguished his nation, the commandant of the 600 troops
who made the expedition to the Pawnees, an officer of distinguished
merit, who in his mode of living fully justified
the pomp and style of his actions, who outshines many of
the governors of provinces, and whom in my future reports
I shall have frequent occasion to quote. He observed to
me: "The governor informs me, Sir, your trunk is under
restrictions; but your word of honor as a soldier that no
papers shall be taken out, and you have free ingress, as
usual." I gave it, and I presume it is scarcely necessary to
add it was religiously adhered to.</p>

<p>On our arrival at Chihuahua the general demanded my
trunk, and on its being opened and the papers laid on the
table, he took them in hand one by one and demanded what
was the purport of each, which truth obliged me to declare;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_830" id="Page_830">830</a></span>
had I been disposed to equivocate, Ensign Walker, of his
Catholic Majesty's service, who stood present and assisted
in the examination, could have immediately detected the
fraud; also, his Excellency understands sufficient of the
English language to discover the general purport of any
paper.</p>

<p>After going through them in this manner and separating
them into two piles, he observed to me: "You will leave
those papers for my inspection, and in the meanwhile, in
concert with Ensign Walker, who will give the Spanish
translation, you will give me a detailed account of your
route, views, destination, etc., during which time I will
examine the papers now before me." With this I complied,
flattering myself that it was his intention to return me my
papers, by his demanding a sketch; also, so great was my
confidence in the all-protecting name of my country, I conceived
it was a greater step than the general would venture
to take, to seize on the papers. But when I had finished
the proposed sketch and presented it, and found a still further
delay, I addressed the general on the subject. After a
few days, some were returned, but I was officially informed
that the remaining papers had been seized, but would be
kept in the secret cabinet of that captain-generalship until
the pleasure of his Catholic Majesty should be known. At
the same time I was presented with a certificate specifying
the number and contents of those detained, and adding that
they were assorted by my own hand, and voluntarily. This
assertion was so contrary to truth, honor, or the line of conduct
a general should have pursued with a young gentleman,
that I took the liberty of telling one of the officers
who signed said certificate that it was incorrect. But as
Sergeant Meek was still in the rear with nearly all my baggage,
I took care to give him orders that none of said
baggage should be opened, except by force; which will
evince that, although I preferred acting like a gentleman to
obliging General Salcedo to resort to rough treatment, yet
that it was not a volunteer surrender of my papers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_831" id="Page_831">831</a></span></p>

<p>But the general will please to recollect that my journals
were saved at Santa Fe, were continued, and are entire to
this post; for the fortunate circumstance of the doctor's
having copied my courses and distances through all the
route, except an excursion we made to the source of the
river La Platte, unto the Spanish territories, preserved them.
These will enable me to exhibit a correct chart of the route,
although not so minute as the one seized on, which was
plotted daily by the eye and angular observations. Thus
the only essential papers lost were my astronomical observations
and meteorological tables, and a book containing
remarks on minerals, plants, etc., with the manners, population,
customs, etc., of the savages. But the results of the
former were in part communicated, and probably my journal
may supply part of the balance, while our memories
will make the loss of the latter of but little consequence.
While in the Spanish territories I was forbidden the use of
pen and paper, notwithstanding which I kept a journal,
made meteorological observations, and took courses and
distances from the time I entered their country until my
arrival at this place; all of which I brought safe off in the
men's guns, where I finally secreted my papers without
detection.</p>

<p>From our unremitting attention day and night, the immense
territory they led us through, and the long time we
were in their country, I make bold to assert I have been
able to collect a correct account of their military force,
regular and irregular; also, important and interesting information
on geographical situations, political sentiments
and dispositions of the people of every class, manners, arts,
resources, riches, revenues, situation, value, and productions
of their mines, etc.; also, the annual revenues paid to Bonaparte.
Had we possessed as great a knowledge of the
Spanish language when we entered the territories as when
we left them, our information would have been nearly as
complete as I could wish it, if sent expressly for the purpose
of acquiring it, by the open authority of his Majesty. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_832" id="Page_832">832</a></span>
the French language, in which my communications were
sometimes made, was greatly beneficial.</p>

<p>By the sergeant, who is still in the rear and was never
suffered to join me, as General Salcedo conceived he would
probably procure some information from him, which he
could not if [the sergeant were] immediately under my
orders, I expect many other communications of importance
from many individuals who promised to forward them by
him. But I presume the general has found himself in
error; as I perceive by a letter from him to Governor
Cordero, the sergeant killed one of his<a name="FNanchor_VP-7" id="FNanchor_VP-7" href="#Footnote_VP-7" class="fnanchor">[V'-7]</a> men, in consequence
of some improper conduct, and the general accuses him of
great intractability, as he is pleased to term it.</p>

<p>From the foregoing statement your Excellency will observe
that I yet possess immense matter, the results of one
year's travel in countries, desert and populated, which have
both been long the subject of curiosity to the philosopher,
the anxious desires of the miser, and the waking thoughts
and sleeping dreams of the man of ambitious and aspiring
soul&mdash;results which, in our present critical situation, I do
conceive to be immensely important, and which open a
scene for the generosity and aggrandizement of our country,
with a wide and splendid field for harvests of honor for
individuals. But my papers are in a mutilated state, from
the absolute necessity I was under to write on small pieces
in the Spanish country; also, from being injured in the gun-barrels,
some of which I filed off three times to take out the
papers. These circumstances make it necessary, in the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_833" id="Page_833">833</a></span>
place, to take a rough copy as they stand; then it will be
necessary to assort the matter, as military, political, moral,
mercantile, meteorological, agricultural, etc., all now forming
an undigested mass. Then, Sir, the combining each, the
plotting, etc., would take up a time of considerable extent
for one man; and to make duplicates after they are in
order could not be done in three months. The general
may recollect it was nearly that period before my reports
were completed last year, although I was assisted by Mr.
[Antoine] Nau and the sergeant-major, and sometimes by
Lieutenants [James B.] Wilkinson and [Henry Richard]
Graham.<a name="FNanchor_VP-8" id="FNanchor_VP-8" href="#Footnote_VP-8" class="fnanchor">[V'-8]</a> Also, with respect to the Spanish country, I
must know the extent of the objects in view, in order to
embrace those points in my reports; and further, my dear
sir, my health is by no means the most perfect, my eyes
being so extremely weak that it is almost impossible for me
to continue for one hour with the pen in my hand, and by
that time I have a considerable pain in my breast.</p>

<p>From those circumstances my general will perceive the
almost impracticability of my complying with the contents of
his letter as to duplicate reports from this place; but I
shall immediately commence the business of arranging and
digesting my papers, and will proceed with the labor with
every perseverance my situation will permit until the arrival
of my sergeant and the balance of the party, should they
not be retarded more than 20 days, when I shall proceed
immediately to St. Louis, and thence through Kentucky,
Virginia, etc., to the Federal City, making no unnecessary
delay, and during the whole of the route prosecuting my
business at every leisure moment. When at Washington, I
flatter myself with your assistance and advice. As I propose
taking courses, distances, etc., hence to St. Louis, it will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_834" id="Page_834">834</a></span>
be making the tour of the greatest part of Louisiana,
crossing the main rivers at different points. I am certain
that from the survey of the Missouri by Captains Lewis
and Clark, my own of the Mississippi, Lieutenant Wilkinson's
of the lower Arkansaw, which river I surveyed to its
sources, and Mr. Dunbar's of Red river, can be formed the
completest survey of Louisiana ever yet taken.</p>

<p>As to the instruments I had with me I wish the general
to inform me in what light they stood, as most of them
were ruined in the mountains by the falling of the horses
from precipices, etc., and I left an order at Chihuahua for
the sergeant to sell them at a certain price, as the addition
of a land carriage of 500 leagues would not add to their
benefit.<a name="FNanchor_VP-9" id="FNanchor_VP-9" href="#Footnote_VP-9" class="fnanchor">[V'-9]</a> Baroney, if alive, is with my sergeant; he has
proved a noble fellow in his line, and I beg liberty to
recommend him to some appointment near the Kans, should
any offer. I must further add the following anecdote of
my men, in whose breasts lay the whole secret of my
papers, and whom I frequently, when in the Spanish territories,
was obliged to punish severely for outrages committed
in a state of intoxication, yet who never once offered,
or showed a disposition to discover it. It is certain they
knew instant death would follow; still, their fidelity to their
trust is remarkable. I have charged them as to communications,
and shall dispose of them in such a manner as not
to put it in their power to give things much publicity.</p>

<p>Dr. Robinson has accompanied me the whole route, is
still with me, and I take pleasure in acknowledging I have
received important services from him, as my companion in
dangers and hardships, counselor in difficulties, and one
to whose chemical, botanical, and mineralogical knowledge
the expedition is greatly indebted&mdash;in short, Sir, he is a
young gentleman of talents, honor, and perseverance, possessing,
in my humble opinion, a military turn of mind, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_835" id="Page_835">835</a></span>
would enter, I believe, in case of an augmentation of the
army, if he could obtain a rank above a subaltern.</p>

<p>I hope the general will be pleased to have my copies
forwarded by Lieutenant Wilkinson, so that I can command
the use of them at Washington; also all my letters
written him during the expedition, as they contain information
I wish to refer to, and the copies were seized. Dr.
[John] Sibley has informed me that the expedition up the
Arkansaw is suspended, which supersedes the necessity of
my sending the express ordered.</p>

<p>I congratulate the general on the safe arrival of Lieutenant
Wilkinson, and am sorry to hear of the difficulties he
encountered. I have been obliged to draw money of the
Spanish government, which I have to pay to their ambassador
at Washington. I supported those of my men who
were with me all the time in the Spanish country. Being
separated from my baggage and never permitted to have it
join me, and having been presented to the commandant-general
in a blanket cappot,<a name="FNanchor_VP-10" id="FNanchor_VP-10" href="#Footnote_VP-10" class="fnanchor">[V'-10]</a> I was under the necessity of
going to very considerable expense to support what I considered
not only my own honor, but the dignity of our
army. This, when a captain's pay is $2,400 per annum, was
a ruinous thing to my finances; but I hope it may be taken
into due consideration.</p>

<p>After making myself pretty perfect in the French language,
I have obtained such a knowledge of the Spanish as
to make me confident in asserting, in three or four years I
will with ease make myself sufficiently master of the latter,
Italian, and Portuguese, to read them all, and speak and
write Spanish. The doctor has even exceeded me in that
point. I mention this to the general, as I know the interest
he takes in the improvement of his military protégé.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_836" id="Page_836">836</a></span></p>

<p>We heard in the Spanish dominions of the convulsions of
the western country, originating in Mr. Burr's plans, and
that you were implicated; sometimes that you were arrested,
sometimes superseded, etc. Those reports, although
I never credited them, gave me great unhappiness, as I
conceived that the shafts of calumny were aimed at your
fame and honor, in a foreign country where these had
hitherto stood high and been revered and respected by
every class. At St. Antonio Colonel Cordero informed me
of the truth of the statement [<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, falsity of those reports],
which took a load from my breast and made me comparatively
happy; I hope ere long the villainy will be unmasked,
and malignity and slander hide their heads. The before
mentioned gentleman sent you by me a box of Spanish
chocolate, which I shall forward to Colonel Cushing. Governor
Herrara said the maliciousness of the world was such
as to forbid his writing, but begged to be sincerely remembered
to you. A letter addressed to me at Cincinnatti, Ohio,
may possibly reach me on my route, when I hope to receive
your approbation of my conduct. Many letters written to
me, addressed to this place, have been secreted or destroyed;
possibly the general can give me a hint on the subject.</p>

<p>Those ideas have made a deep impression on my mind,
and did not an all-ruling passion sway me irresistibly to
the profession of arms and the paths of military glory, I
would long since have resigned my sword for the rural cot,
where peace, health, and content would at least be our
inmates, should not our brows be crowned with laurel.</p>

<p>I must now conclude, as this letter has far exceeded the
bounds proposed when commenced; but the effusions of
my heart on its contents are such that I could not limit
them to a more contracted space. Excuse my scrawl, as I
am entirely out of practice, but believe me to be,</p>

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">Natchitoches</span>, August 20th, 1807.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>Previous to my departure from Chihuahua, we had
entered so fully into the subject of the seizure of my
papers, that I should never have made another appeal until
I made one through our government to the ambassador of
his Catholic Majesty, had I not received orders to that
effect; it not being known, at the time those instructions
were given, that the propriety of the seizure had been contested
between your Excellency and myself. But as you
have now had time fully to reconsider the business, it may
not appear in the same light that it did when I had the
honor to address you before. Your Excellency may be
induced to conceive that the measure of seizing my notes,
plans, meteorological and astronomical observations, etc.,
for parts of the Mississippi, Missouri, Osage, Kans, and
Arkansaw rivers&mdash;waters acknowledged by the Spanish
government to be within the known territories of the
United States&mdash;may not be justifiable. Whatever may be
your opinion on those subjects, I am at an entire loss to
conceive how, and upon what principle, you could involve
in that seizure letters from individuals to individuals, the
contents of which could in no wise be interesting to the
Spanish government.</p>

<p>I have therefore once more to appeal to your Excellency,
with the hope that the time you have had for deliberation
may induce you to conceive it proper, and but an act of
justice, to deliver up the papers seized at Chihuahua; and
hope your Excellency will have the goodness to address
them to me in a packet, to the care of the commanding
officer of this place.</p>

<p>If the continuation of an amicable understanding between
the two nations be an object of estimation in the mind of
your Excellency, the final demarcation of limits must be
considered as the first great step to be taken toward its
accomplishment. To enable my government to form a correct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_838" id="Page_838">838</a></span>
idea on that subject, it was requisite they should be
well acquainted with the geographical situation of the heads
of the Arkansaw and Red rivers. The former part of this
[requirement] I had accomplished, and could with all ease
have carried the remaining part of that object into execution,
after discovering my mistake of the Rio del Norte for
the Red river, had I been permitted by the governor of
New Mexico. Instead of which, I was hurried through the
country to Chihuahua, without having time given for the
absent part of my party and baggage to join me; by which
means I was obliged to appear in a garb and manner
entirely incompatible with the rank I have the honor to
hold, and in some degree an indignity [was thus offered] to
the country whose commission I bear. To add to my
mortification, I was then deprived of the information I had
obtained at the risk of our lives, and the suffering of unknown
miseries. The information contained in my notes
was not only of a geographical nature, but also such as
would enable the executive of the United States to take
some steps to ameliorate the barbarous state of various
savage tribes whom I visited; and, I may be permitted to
add, would have added in some small degree to the acquirement
of science, which is for the general benefit of mankind.</p>

<p>When I left Chihuahua, I was informed that my sergeant
and party were detained near the place, in order that they
should not be permitted to join me, [and to the end] that
by a separate examination they might be intimidated to
make a declaration to justify the conduct observed toward
us. This I am conscious must have failed; but I am at an
entire loss to conceive why they should have been detained
until this time, when your Excellency assured me they
should follow immediately. Their detention has been of
considerable private injury to myself, and an insult to my
government.</p>

<p>When I marched from Chihuahua, your Excellency
officially informed me that everything had been prepared for
my transport to our lines. I was much surprised to have to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_839" id="Page_839">839</a></span>
pay for the hire of horses, etc., demanded of me at the
first place where we changed our escorts, as I neither conceived
it just that I should pay for an involuntary tour
I had taken through your territories, nor was I prepared to
do it; but as your officers were responsible, and gave their
receipts for the transport, and from the orders received by
Captain Viana at Nacogdoches, I was obliged to hire beasts
to take me to Natchitoches, although an escort of your
troops were furnished. [See <a href="#Footnote_VP-2">note<sup>2</sup>, p. 814</a>].</p>

<p>I here with the greatest pleasure embrace the opportunity
of acknowledging the polite treatment I received from
your officers in general on my route, but in particular from
Colonels Cordero and Herrara, Captains Barelo and Viana,
and Lieutenant Malgares; to all of whom it would be my
greatest pleasure to have it in my power to return the
compliment.</p>

<p>Will your Excellency do me the honor to present my
high respects to your lady, and my compliments to Mr.
Truxillo and Father Rocus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>I herewith inclose copies of the instructions to Lieutenant
Pike, for the government of his conduct on the two exploring
expeditions alluded to in your letter; and likewise lists
of the names of the men composing those parties. You
will perceive that the instructions were given by General
Wilkinson; the objects, however, of each party, together
with the instructions, were communicated to and approved
by the president of the United States.</p>

<p>Although no special encouragement was given to the individuals
who performed these laborious and dangerous expeditions,
yet it was but reasonable for them, should they
fortunately succeed in their objects, to expect a liberal
reward from the government; and as there can be no reasonable
doubt of the zeal, perseverance, and intelligence of

<span class="smcap">Headquarters</span>, St. Louis, July 30th, 1805.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>Having completed your equipments, you are to proceed
up the Mississippi with all possible diligence, taking
the following instructions for your general government,
which are to yield to your discretion in all cases of
exigency.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_843" id="Page_843">843</a></span></p>

<p>You will please to take the course of the river, and calculate
distances by time, noting rivers, creeks, highlands,
prairies, islands, rapids, shoals, mines, quarries, timber,
water, soil, Indian villages and settlements, in a diary, to
comprehend reflections on the winds and weather.</p>

<p>It is interesting to government to be informed of the
population and residence of the several Indian nations, of
the quantity and species of skins and furs they barter per
annum, and their relative price to goods; of the tracts of
country on which they generally make their hunts, and the
people with whom they trade.</p>

<p>You will be pleased to examine strictly for an intermediate
point, between this place and the Prairie des Chiens,
suitable for a military post, and also on the Ouiscousing,
near its mouth, for a similar establishment; and will obtain
the consent of the Indians for their erection, informing them
that they are intended to increase their trade and ameliorate
their condition.</p>

<p>You will proceed to ascend the main branch of the river
until you reach the source of it, or the season may forbid
your further progress without endangering your return
before the waters are frozen up.</p>

<p>You will endeavor to ascertain the latitude of the most
remarkable places in your route, with the extent of the
navigation and the direction of the different rivers which
fall into the Mississippi, and you will not fail to procure
specimens of whatever you may find curious, in the
mineral, vegetable, or animal kingdoms, to be rendered
at this place.</p>

<p>In your course you are to spare no pains to conciliate the
Indians and to attach them to the United States, and you
may invite the great chiefs of such distant nations as have
not been at this place, to pay me a visit.</p>

<p>Your own good sense will regulate the consumption of
your provisions, and direct the distribution of the trifling
presents which you may carry with you, particularly
your flags.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_844" id="Page_844">844</a></span></p>

Your obedient servant,<br />
<span class="i2">[Signed] <span class="smcap">James Wilkinson</span>.</span></p>

<p>P. S. In addition to the preceding orders, you will be
pleased to obtain permission from the Indians who claim the
ground, for the erection of military posts and trading-houses
at the mouth of the river St. Pierre, the falls of St. Anthony,
and every other critical point which may fall under your
observation; these permissions to be granted in formal conferences,
regularly recorded, and the ground marked off.</p>

<span class="smcap">War Department</span>, Feb. 24th, 1808.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>In answer to your letter of the 22d instant, I can with
pleasure observe, that although the two exploring expeditions
you have performed were not previously ordered by
the president of the United States, there were frequent
communications on the subject of each between General
Wilkinson and this department, of which the president of the
United States was from time to time acquainted; and it will
be no more than what justice requires to say that your conduct,
in each of those expeditions, met the approbation of
the president; and that the information you obtained and
communicated to the executive, in relation to the source of
the Mississippi and the natives in that quarter, and the country
generally, as well on the Upper Mississippi as that
between the Arkansaw and the Missouri, and on the borders
of the latter extensive river to its source and the country
adjacent, has been considered highly interesting in a political,
geographical, and historical view. And you may rest
assured that your services are held in high estimation by the
president of the United States; and if any opinion of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_845" id="Page_845">845</a></span>
own can afford you any satisfaction, I very frankly declare
that I consider the public much indebted to you for the enterprising,
persevering, and judicious manner in which you
have performed them.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<p><i>Sketch of an Expedition made from St. Louis, to explore the
internal parts of Louisiana, by order of his Excellency,
General James Wilkinson. (Orig. No. 13, pp. 73-77.)</i></p>

<p>I embarked at Belle Fontaine, on the Missouri, near its
confluence with the Mississippi, with a command of one
lieutenant, one doctor (a volunteer), two sergeants, one corporal,
17 [16] privates, and one interpreter;<a name="FNanchor_VIP-2" id="FNanchor_VIP-2" href="#Footnote_VIP-2" class="fnanchor">[VI'-2]</a> having under
my charge eight or ten Osage chiefs who had recently
returned from a visit to the city of Washington, together
with about 40 men, women, and children of the same nation,
redeemed from captivity from another Indian nation; and
two Pawnees who had likewise been to the city of Washington
[making a total of 51 Indians].</p>

<p>We ascended the Missouri river to the river of the Osage,
up which we ascended to the Osage towns, and arrived on
or about the 18th of August [<a href="#Page_385">p. 385</a>], and delivered to their
nation in safety their chiefs, women, and children, with
speeches to the nation.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_846" id="Page_846">846</a></span></p>

<p>Here I remained making astronomical observations, and
preparing for my march by land, until the 1st of September,
when we took our departure for the Pawnee Republic, accompanied
by some Osage chiefs, who were deputed by
their nation to form a treaty of peace and amity with the
nation of the Kans with whom they were then at war,
under the auspices of the United States. I arrived at the
Pawnee Republic about the 25th of said month [<a href="#Page_409">p. 409</a>],
where I caused to be held a conference between the Osage
and Kans chiefs, and mediated a peace for the two nations.
Having held councils with the Pawnees, made astronomical
observations, etc., I marched from the said village on the
7th of October, and arrived at the Arkansaw on the 11th
[read 15th] of said month, where we remained until the
28th, preparing canoes, etc., for Lieutenant Wilkinson, who
descended the said river, with one sergeant, six men, and
two Osage Indians.<a name="FNanchor_VIP-3" id="FNanchor_VIP-3" href="#Footnote_VIP-3" class="fnanchor">[VI'-3]</a> During my stay at said river, I likewise
made astronomical observations.</p>

<p>On the said day I marched with the remainder of the
party up the Arkansaw. Nothing occurred worthy of note
until about the middle [on the 22d] of November, when we
met a party of Pawnees, of 60 warriors, who were returning
from an expedition against the Kayaways. At first our conference
was of the most friendly nature, and I made them some
small presents; but as they commenced to steal and plunder
whatever they could with impunity, we were finally obliged to
take to our arms, and were on the point of coming to hostilities,
when the Pawnees retired, and we pursued our march.</p>

<p>We arrived where the Arkansaw enters the mountains, on
the 4th or 5th [5th] of December, where we remained until
the 9th [10th], searching for the route across the mountains,
when we marched by a trace which we discovered, leaving
the main Arkansaw to our left. Much to our astonishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_847" id="Page_847">847</a></span>
we arrived about the middle of said month [Dec. 13th] on a
water of the Missouri, which I ascertained to be the [South
fork of the] river Platte, on which we discovered signs of
immense numbers of Indians. Here we remained a few
days searching for those Indians, in hopes to obtain from
them information as to a route to cross the mountains to
the west; but not discovering any, we crossed a large
chain [Park range] by a practicable route [Trout Creek pass]
and fell on a large branch of water which I then conceived
to be the head of the Red river [but which was the Arkansaw].
Here we remained a few days [till Dec. 21st] to
recruit our horses and ourselves, when I ordered the party
to proceed down said river, and I with two men ascended
it [nearly] to its source, where I made some observations.
I then returned and overtook the party, when we continued
to descend said stream, until the perpendicularity
of the rocks [of the Grand Cañon of the Arkansaw] and
other difficulties rendered it impossible to proceed any
further with horses, several of which had already been killed
by falling from the rocks, etc.</p>

<p>I then caused sleds to be constructed, and soldiers to draw
the baggage on the ice, and ordered a few men to endeavor
to conduct the horses by a more eligible route out of the
mountains; at the extremity of which we all arrived by the
9th of January, and found that we had descended the main
branch of the Arkansaw, conceiving it to be the Red river,
and were again at the same point [Cañon City] we had left
on the 9th [10th] ult.</p>

<p>My remaining horses not being in a situation to allow me
to hope for any further assistance from them, unless permitted
further to recover, and as this would have engrossed
a long time, I determined to leave some men with the
horses and part of the baggage, and proceed with the remainder
and the articles absolutely necessary, on foot. On
the 14th of January, having constructed a small place for my
men and baggage who remained, we marched, proceeding
up a western branch [Grape creek] of the Arkansaw, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_848" id="Page_848">848</a></span>
appeared to lead in a direct route through the mountains.
On the 20th of said month, being obliged to cross a prairie
[Wet Mountain valley] of some leagues in breadth, late in
the evening, and many of the soldiers having their feet wet,
we had it not in our power to make fire until eight or nine
o'clock at night. We were so unfortunate as to ascertain
that nine of the party were frozen. The ensuing day, discovering
that they were not all able to march, we remained a
few days to lay in provisions. Here I left two soldiers and
four loads of our baggage, and proceeded on our march; but
on the third day, finding another of my men not able to
march, I was obliged to leave him encamped, having previously
furnished him with sufficient provision. We then
crossed another chain [Sangre de Cristo] of mountains, and
on the 1st of February [31st of January] arrived on the
waters of the Rio del Norte, which I then conceived to be
the Red river, as some maps which I held portrayed the
source of the Red river to lie between those of the Arkansaw
and Rio del Norte. I then proceeded to choose a
station [on the Rio Conejos] where there was sufficient
wood to form canoes or rafts, in order to descend the supposed
[Red] river to Natchitoches.</p>

<p>Having in many instances experienced the insolence and
presuming dispositions of the Indians, when in superior
numbers, I conceived it proper to throw up a small work
for the protection of ourselves and baggage, until we should
be prepared to descend the river.</p>

<p>Four or five days [seven] after I dispatched five men to
return to those I had left in the mountains, and bring them
on, if capable of marching; if not, to supply them with
provision and bring on the baggage. Dr. Robinson, who
had hitherto accompanied me as a volunteer, having some
pecuniary demands in the province of New Mexico, conceived
that this would be the nearest point from which he
could go in and probably return, previous to my being prepared
to descend the river. He left me on the 7th of
February with that view.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_849" id="Page_849">849</a></span></p>

<p>A few days after [on Feb. 16th], hunting with one of my
men, I discovered two men on horseback. I would have
avoided them, agreeably to my orders; but, finding they
continued to pursue us, I conceived it most proper to bring
them to a conference. This, with great difficulty, I effected,
as they appeared to be apprehensive that my intentions
were hostile toward them. I conducted them to my camp,
informed them of my intention to descend the river, and
made them some small presents. Had they then informed
me of my being on the Rio del Norte, I should have immediately
retired; but, having executed their commission,
they returned the following day on the immediate route to
the [Spanish] settlements. The following day [Feb. 17th]
the party I had detached for the men whom I had been
compelled to leave in the mountains, returned with one
only, and all the baggage, the other two not being able to
come on. I then immediately [Feb. 19th] dispatched my
sergeant and one man, to order and conduct on the men,
horses, and baggage left on the Arkansaw, by a route which
I conceived practicable.</p>

<p>On the 24th or 25th [26th] of February, in the morning,
two Frenchmen arrived at my camp, and informed me that
an officer and 50 men of his Catholic Majesty's troops had
marched from Santa Fe, in order to protect me from the
Utahs, who had exhibited a disposition to attack me, and
would probably be at my camp in two or three days. In the
course of two or three hours, I was informed by a sentinel,
whom I always kept on a hill, of the approach of a party of
strangers; and in a short period there arrived two officers
and 100 men, at a small distance from the camp. The
lieutenant commandant, having entered my works by my
invitation, informed me that the governor of New Mexico
had been informed of my situation; and, understanding
I was bound for Red river, offered me any assistance which
lay in his power to accommodate me. I replied that I stood
in no need of assistance; that I could descend the river with
craft which I proposed constructing. He then informed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_850" id="Page_850">850</a></span>
me I was on the Rio del Norte, which astonished me
extremely, and that the source of the Red river was eight
days' march below Santa Fe; and that the governor, being
informed that I had missed my route, offered mules, horses,
etc., to conduct me to the Red river, and wished to see me
at his seat of government. I told him that if the whole of
my party were here, I would not hesitate to pay my respects
to his Excellency, with one or two men. He then assured
me that there was not the least constraint; that I could go
in before or after the arrival of my party, as my inclination
dictated; that if I went in now he would leave an Utah
interpreter and one man, with the men of my party I chose
to leave, in order to conduct the sergeant and party when
they arrived. I finally concluded it would be more consistent
with the good understanding which existed between
the government of the United States and his Catholic
Majesty, to proceed to Santa Fe, and give to Governor
Allencaster an explanation of my being on his frontiers.
We then marched for his [the Spanish lieutenant's] camp,
about 12 miles distant, leaving the [Utah] interpreter, one
Spanish soldier, a corporal [Jackson] and one private
[Carter] of my detachment, with orders for the conduct of
my sergeant [Meek] when he should arrive.</p>

<p>The next day I was much surprised to find that the
lieutenant and all the regular troops, except 10, were to
remain, and that the militia officer was to conduct me to
Santa Fe; the lieutenant giving as a reason the particular
orders to see all my party in safety at the capital. We
arrived at the town in four or five days [Mar. 3d], where I
was received at first in a manner very different from what
I had been taught to expect from the proffers of the lieutenant
in the name of the governor. The arms of my men
being taken possession of by the guard the first night of my
arrival, without my knowledge, and my being likewise informed
that Dr. Robinson was a prisoner at some leagues'
distance, they induced me to believe that a rupture had taken
place between Spain and the United States, and to address
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_851" id="Page_851">851</a></span>
a letter to the governor, demanding if I was to consider
myself and party as prisoners of war, and if the expense
arising from the detention of myself and party was to be
defrayed by the United States or his Catholic Majesty. To
this his Excellency gave me a very polite verbal answer,
assuring me that I was by no means to consider myself as
a prisoner; that the arms of my men were taken unknown
to him, and should be immediately restored; but that it was
necessary I should march immediately to join Lieutenant
Malgares and party, who were waiting for me at the village
of St. Fernandez, in order to conduct me to Chihuahua, to
be presented to the commandant-general with my papers
for an explanation. On my arriving at said village, I addressed
a letter to the governor, informing him that Dr.
Robinson had accompanied my party as a volunteer. This
I had not acknowledged at Santa Fe, as I was apprehensive
that his coming on to the frontiers of the province with
a military party, in case of a rupture between the two governments,
might place him in a critical position.<a name="FNanchor_VIP-4" id="FNanchor_VIP-4" href="#Footnote_VIP-4" class="fnanchor">[VI'-4]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_852" id="Page_852">852</a></span></p>

<p>The lieutenant [Pike] only further observes that he has
not entered into the particulars of the hardships undergone,
such as enduring thirst or famine for three or four days, at
different periods; marching over rugged mountains, through
snows three or four feet deep, exposed to every inclemency
of the weather for want of clothes, carrying at the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_853" id="Page_853">853</a></span>

<h2 class="fntitle">FOOTNOTES</h2>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-1" id="Footnote_I-1" href="#FNanchor_I-1"><span class="label">[I-1]</span></a> Belle Fontaine or Bellefontaine is the name of the large cemetery in the environs
of St. Louis, where William Clark lies buried; and probably few persons
now living know its proper geographical connotation. The cemetery is
four miles from the Court House, and ten miles further is the place whose name
was given to the burying-ground on the road thither, after its original designation
as the Rural Cemetery. Belle Fontaine was a place on the south bank of
the river, 14 m. north of St. Louis, in what is now St. Ferdinand township of
St. Louis Co. (Sect. 10, T. 47 N., R. 7 E. of this county). Before there
was any such "place," or locality, Belle Fontaine was the French name of
the creek which falls in there, which had been called Ferdinand by the Spanish,
and which became known to the English as Cold Water creek, there being a
fine large spring under the bluffs, close to the Missouri. This, however, was
washed away by the encroachment of the river. We find the latter name in
Lewis and Clark, who made the first camp of their expedition on Green isl., opposite
the mouth of the creek, May 14th, 1804. There was nothing then at the
place that was soon to become forever notable as the spot where was built the
first military post ever established in the newly acquired territory of Louisiana.
Much early history attaches to the locality, some of which may be here epitomized,
mainly on the basis of Billon's Annals. In 1768, when St. Louis was but
begun, Captain Rios arrived with 25 soldiers under orders from Count Ulloa to
establish Spanish authority in the region where things were at a standstill, if not
in distraction. Rios was persona non grata in the infant St. Louis; he withdrew,
and selected Belle Fontaine as a suitable location for a post. Late in 1768
he there built a fort which he called Fort Prince Charles in honor of the son of
his king and heir apparent to the Spanish throne. In 1769 Rios left with his men;
in 1770 Piernas came. The Spanish presidio was soon turned into a commercial
factory or trading-post. On Sept. 10th, 1797, Governor Zenon Trudeau
granted to Hezekiah Lord a concession of 1,000 arpents of land on Belle Fontaine
or Cold Water cr.; and on the site of the former Spanish fort Lord built a
house and mill. He died in 1799; his estate was sold in partition in 1803,
when 600 arpents were bought by William Massey. In 1805, General James
Wilkinson selected the place for a military establishment, and United States
troops were first cantoned in temporary quarters during the winter of 1805-6.
This was the original Cantonment Belle Fontaine. On April 20th, 1806, General
Wilkinson purchased from Massey, on behalf of the United States, five acres
of ground with the improvements, called Belle Fontaine, with the use for five
years of the ground on which had been located the cantonment, and upon these
five acres established a permanent post. In July, 1806, he purchased the rest
of the tract of 500 arpents, which was conveyed to the United States in Mar.,
1809. Belle Fontaine was really the parent of Jefferson Barracks; for, after
the establishment of Forts Atkinson, Snelling, and others on the Missouri and
Mississippi frontiers, it lost its importance from a military point of view, and
was abandoned for the site of the present Jefferson Barracks. This in 1825; on
July 4th of which year Colonel Talbot Chambers, with four companies of the 1st
United States Infantry, evacuated Belle Fontaine and proceeded to the new site
which had been selected, though the place remained for some ten years in charge
of a military storekeeper, Major John Whistler. General Lewis Cass, Secretary
of War under Van Buren, ordered it to be sold at public auction in 1836. It
was bought by Jamison Samuel, Dunham Spalding, H. N. Davis, and E. L.
Langham, who laid out a paper town that never came to anything. Agriculture
finally reclaimed Belle Fontaine after the military occupancy; it was bought for
a farm by the late Dr. David C. Tandy of St. Louis, whose son, Robert E.
Tandy, now or lately did live there. The old road can still be traced in part
over ground where it ran more than a century ago.</p>

village was then the seat of justice of the District of St. Charles, Louisiana Territory,
as it is now of St. Charles Co., Mo. The Wabash, St. L. and Pac. R.
R. bridged the Mo. r. here; opposite is Bon Fils station; also Brotherton. St.
Charles was not so called till 1784; the place had been known as Les Petites
Côtes, where the hunter Blanchette settled about 1770: <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43774/43774-h/43774-h.htm#Footnote_III-41">note<sup>41</sup>, p. 214</a>. In to-day's
journey Pike passed the place known as Piper's (or Fifer's) ldg.: see the mark
"Ferry" on his map. The principal point was the coal hill on the south, then
known as La Charbonnière, now Charbonnier pt. A present or recent place
of ferriage is Music's or Hall's; some of the landings are Heagler's, Kemp's,
and Orick's or Orrick's; some of the present islands above the Pelicans are
Charbonnier or Mullanphy, Holmes, and Vingt-une. There was a marsh or lake
on the N. side, 5 or 6 m. below St. Charles, which the French called Marais
Croche, Crooked marsh; some maps now make it Marie Croche l.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-5" id="Footnote_I-5" href="#FNanchor_I-5"><span class="label">[I-5]</span></a> M. de Lisa was one of the most noted Missourian Indian traders in those
days. This is certainly not the last, and probably not the first, time he played
exactly that trick. Pike has a good deal to say of him further on: see also L.
and C., pp. lxxix, 62, 242, 256, 443, 1153, 1154, 1232, where my notes refer to
further information in Brackenridge's Travels and Irving's Astoria. Lisa was at
one time associated with Captain Clark in the fur-trade.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-6" id="Footnote_I-6" href="#FNanchor_I-6"><span class="label">[I-6]</span></a> One of the two letters Pike wrote to Wilkinson formed No. 3 of the App.

to the place presently.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-9" id="Footnote_I-9" href="#FNanchor_I-9"><span class="label">[I-9]</span></a> This mileage would set Pike about Cottleville ldg., on the N., though I
hardly think he got quite so far. He passed Fee Fee and Crèvec&oelig;ur creeks on
the S., latter discharging from Crèvec&oelig;ur l.; Little Duckett and Big Duckett
creeks, near together, on the N.; Catfish isl., behind which is Howard bend,
into which Bon Homme or Good Man's r. falls, about opposite the middle of
Green's bottom, N., 3½ m. long, separated by Green's chute from Bon Homme
isl., next above which comes Bacon's or Post's isl., and then Cottleville ldg. If
Pike reached this place, he was 44 m. from the mouth of the Missouri, according
to recent charts.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-10" id="Footnote_I-10" href="#FNanchor_I-10"><span class="label">[I-10]</span></a> Late Sergeant Henry Kennerman, reduced to the ranks for cause at Pike's
stockade on the Upper Mississippi r., Mar. 9th, 1806: see <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43774/43774-h/43774-h.htm#Page_181">p. 181</a> and <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43774/43774-h/43774-h.htm#Footnote_V-10">note<sup>10</sup>,
p. 245</a>. He was posted as a deserter in various places, but we are not told he
was retaken. He drops out of the story at this point. With Kennerman
deserted, Vasquez arrested, and Geo. Henry engaged, the whites of the party are
now 23 - 2 + 1 = 22; Vasquez rejoins on the 21st, when the roster is again 23.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-11" id="Footnote_I-11" href="#FNanchor_I-11"><span class="label">[I-11]</span></a> Position uncertain, especially as the text of the 18th-20th cannot be squared
with the camp-marks on Pike's map. Going by the text, which agrees with the
actual geography better than the map does, we may set Pike in the vicinity of
St. Albans. To reach this point from his last camp he passes places on the N.
now known as Cottleville ldg., Hamburg, and Dozier's ldg. At the last named
Femme Osage r. falls into the lower end of Dozier's bend. The Missouri is
here 1½-2 m. broad, and mostly filled with Howell's isl., 2½ m. long, some
small islands, and various sand-bars. Thence on the N. or rather N. W. is a
bottom 8 m. long and a mile or more deep; while on the S. E. is a nearly unbroken
line of bluffs which the river washes from Port Royal (in Franklin Co.,
just over the border of St. Louis Co.) to St. Albans. At one place in these rocks
is the cave formerly, and perhaps still, known as the Tavern: see L. and C., ed.
1893, p. 8, and Pike's map, place lettered "Cave." The small stream which
makes in on the S. W. at St. Albans is still called Tavern cr.; and directly
opposite is Murdoch's ldg. The Mo. R. Comm. charts of 1879 mark a place
Missouriton on the N. W., 2 m. below Murdoch's ldg. Nicollet's map, pub.
1843, marks Missouriton on the N., slightly <i>below</i> mouth of Femme Osage r.,
about position of present Hamburg.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-12" id="Footnote_I-12" href="#FNanchor_I-12"><span class="label">[I-12]</span></a> The "point to the south" which Pike passes I take to be that opp. Cottlebaum's
ldg., at the mouth of Ridenour or Fiddle cr., at the head of the difficult
place called Devil's Race-ground by Lewis and Clark: see ed. of 1893, p. 8.
This is a couple of miles above St. Albans, at the 55th river-mile point of recent
surveys. The bluffs continue a mile or so, and then, at the mouth of
Labadie's cr. or slough, begins the extensive Labadie's bottom on the S., for
the Missouri crosses over to the bluffs on the N., and continues on that side to
the town of Augusta, St. Charles Co. Thence the channel runs obliquely by the
Augusta and Hinkley bends, between Labadie's and Hancock's bottoms, to the S.
side again. Here, at Mung's or South Point isl., is the lower end of the "long
reach," N. W., in which Pike says he camped. We set him on the S., at the
mouth of Dubois or Wood cr., where there is now a place called South Point.
This is directly opposite the line between St. Charles and Warren cos. on the
N.; it is about 2 m. below Washington, Franklin Co., and at the 67th mile-point
from the mouth of the Missouri. Pike maps the stream in the right place,
but by the wrong name of "Ash R."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-13" id="Footnote_I-13" href="#FNanchor_I-13"><span class="label">[I-13]</span></a> The proper name of the interpreter, whom Pike usually calls "Baroney,"
was A. F. Baronet Vasquez. He was b. St. Louis, 1783; his wife was Emily
Faustine Parent. He was the son of Benito Vasquez (b. 1750) and Julia Papin
(married Nov. 27th, 1774), and was the fifth child of 12 they had. He appears
in army registers as Barony Vasquez, appointed to be an ensign in the
2nd Infantry Dec. 12th, 1808; transferred to 1st Infantry Oct. 31st, 1810;
commissioned as second lieutenant Mar. 4th, 1811; promoted to a first lieutenancy
July 30th, 1813; and resigned Oct. 1st, 1814. See also a letter about
him in my <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43774/43774-h/43774-h.htm#Page_LXIV">Memoir of Pike, <i>anteà</i></a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-14" id="Footnote_I-14" href="#FNanchor_I-14"><span class="label">[I-14]</span></a> See <a href="#Footnote_I-7">note<sup>7</sup>, p. 361</a>. La Charette is still the name of the stream, and of the
extensive bottom on the N. side through which the river seeks the Missouri.
But the settlement once so called is not to be found by this name on modern maps.
Instead of this we have Marthasville (3 m. N. of which stands still the house in
which Daniel Boone died), a village about a mile from the Missouri, and nearly
midway between the points where La Charette cr. and Tuque cr. respectively enter
the bottom. Marthasville appears on maps of 50 years ago, as for example, on
Nicollet's, 1843. Gass calls the place St. Johns where he camped May 25th,
1804; it then had seven houses: see L. and C., ed. 1893, p. 8. St. Johns is now
the name of the largest one of a cluster of islands and sand-bars in an expanded
part of the Missouri, between the mouth of La Charette cr. on the N. and of
St. Johns or Bourbeuse cr. on the S., 2 m. and more above the town of Washington,
Franklin Co. Pike maps "S<sup>t</sup>. Johns R." correctly between his "Ash
R." (error for Wood or Dubois cr.) and his "Bay R." (error for B&oelig;uf r.).
Washington is the most notable place Pike passes to-day; it is now quite a
town, large enough to have started a place opposite itself, called North Washington,
on Lac's pt. in Warren Co. Here is where, at the 69th river-mile point,
a creek falls in on the N.; it is commonly called Tuque cr., though Sheet III.
of the Mo. R. Comm. charts has "Duke" as the name. It looks like a French
word, but whether it be a personal name, or derived from <i>Toque</i> or <i>Turque</i>,
does not appear. It is one of two creeks which L. and C. speak of passing on
the N., May 25th; the other one of these has never been identified. But
there is an old lake bed, or something of the sort, a couple of miles back of
North Washington, in Hancock's bottom, under the bluffs, and I imagine this
once discharged about opp. Dubois or Wood cr.&mdash;say at Rieskamp's place, on
the boundary between St. Charles and Warren cos. Tuque cr. itself seems to
have had more than one outlet, in the course of the several miles it meanders
the low land and separates Hancock's bottom from La Charette.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-15" id="Footnote_I-15" href="#FNanchor_I-15"><span class="label">[I-15]</span></a> Originally Docs. Nos. 5 and 6, p. 33 and p. 36 of the App. to Pt. 2. They

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-16" id="Footnote_I-16" href="#FNanchor_I-16"><span class="label">[I-16]</span></a> To camp at New Haven, Franklin Co., a considerable town which has
grown up of late years at the place formerly known as Miller's ldg., on the S.,
a little below Pinckney pt. Passing through Charette bend, beyond Patton's
pt. and ldg., Pike comes to the mouth of the Rivière au B&oelig;uf of the
French, now B&oelig;uf or Buffalo r., which falls in on the S. behind B&oelig;uf, Buffalo,
or Shelton's isl., about a mile below Dundee station of the Mo. Pac. R. R.
This is the stream by error lettered "Bay R." on Pike's map. On rounding
Emily and Miller bends, Pike comes to his camp, say at the 85th river-mile
point of late surveys. Here he is 1½ m. below a place which was charted by
Nicollet in 1843 as Griswold, and which may be found on maps of but few years
ago, but has since disappeared. On the N., opp. Griswold, was a place called
Pinckney or Pinckneyville, seat of Warren Co. about 1825, and there is still a
hamlet of the same name in the vicinity. The Shepherd r. which the above
text mentions falls in about a mile above Griswold and the same below the
present R. R. station Etlah. This is Shepherd's cr. of L. and C., ed. 1893, p. 9,
but is oftener now called Berger r. or cr. I am told by R. J. Holcombe that
the word is not the common F. noun <i>berger</i>, a shepherd, but a personal name,
probably of the old German pioneer Caspar Burger, a founder of the colony
there; if so, it should not have been translated into English. The word is mangled
into "Boeger" on the beautiful chart of the Mo. R. Comm. It is a pity that so
many cases as bad as this one mar the lettering of such fine draughtsman's work
as Mr. D. W. Wellman's. Berger's or Burger's cr. comes into the bottom 2 m.
above its mouth, and is there joined by Little Berger's or Burger's cr., which runs
about 4½ m. in the bottom before its confluence; the two thus make what is
known as Berger's (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, Burger's) bottom nearly an island, 6 or 7 m. long.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-17" id="Footnote_I-17" href="#FNanchor_I-17"><span class="label">[I-17]</span></a> On rounding Pinckney pt. through the bend of that name, Pike passes the
mouth of Berger's cr., opp. Yeager's ldg., crosses to the N. side of the Missouri,
and sails along with Berger's bottom on his left for several miles; he goes by
Whitehouse's isl., near which L. and C. were camped May 26th, 1804, and
on finishing with Berger's bottom, reaches a place on the N. called Bridgeport.
This is pretty old for a Missouri River town; we find it located more than 50
years ago, and it still exists in name, but has never amounted to much.
Opp. Bridgeport is Bates' isl., 2 m. long, the largest one of several at the head
of Berger's bottom. In the vicinity of Bridgeport several small creeks fall in on
the N. Three of these are called Lost cr., Massas (qu. Massey's?) cr., and Malhern
(qu. Malheur?) cr. Excepting Lost cr., these fall into Chenal à Loutre or
Otter slough; and this snicarty cuts off a very large piece of bottom known as
Île à Loutre or Otter isl. L. and C. speak of this as nearly 10 m. long, and say
that it was one of the most fertile in the whole river. The details of the river
bottom along here seem to have altered a good deal since 1804, and even since
Long's time; the upper end of the slough is now a little above Hermann, near
McGirk's isl. and ldg., cutting the island down to a total length of not over 7 m.
The slough itself is very narrow, and hardly more than a sluggish creek, like a
good many others that meander bottoms before they discharge. L. and C.
speak of three creeks which fall in behind Otter isl., and one of these as having
the same name. This is Rivière à la Loutre of early F. settlers, now Loutre,
Louter, or Luter r., and Otter r., very curiously lettered on the Mo. R. Comm.
map, as "L'Outre"&mdash;a form which only needs an accent to be decidedly <i>outré</i>.
Pike maps the stream as "Otter Riv." He proceeds by Otter or Loutre Island
bend to a mile or so above Hermann, and camps on the S. In finishing the
bend just named he passes on the S. the county line between Franklin and
Gasconade, which cuts through Bates' isl., and then on the N. the line between
Warren and Montgomery cos., which cuts the upper part of Otter isl. at
the lower point of Hermann isl., opp. the town of this name. This is now
quite a place, and more than 50 years old. It is situated across the mouth of
Rivière aux Frênes of the F., commonly called Frene cr. and Ash cr., but uncommonly
appearing as "Frame" cr. on the Mo. R. Comm. map. Pike does
not map Ash cr., though it is given under this name by L. and C.: for the
stream he marks "Ash R." by mistake, see <a href="#Footnote_I-12">note<sup>12</sup>, p. 363</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote">Loutre isl. is quite historic. A number of Americans and some French
families settled there in 1805; first child born was Jacob Grosjean (name corrupted
to Groshong); one b. 1806 became the local celebrity known as "old
man Patton," living in 1884. Fort Clemson was built by Capt. Clemson about
1808, and maintained till after the war of 1812-15. From 1808 to 1816
there was quite a colony, whence were drawn the settlers for Boone's Lick,
Howard Co. On the N. mainland the colonists, when the war broke out, were
killed in part, and the rest driven to the island to be "forted up" till the peace.
Fort Clemson was a Rangers' hdqrs. in the war, and from this post Capt. James
Callaway, grandson of Daniel Boone, set out in March, 1815, on the expedition
up Loutre r., during which he and others were killed. Daniel Boone's Spanish
grant from Gov. Delassus was about 15 m. up the Loutre, and included a salt
spring&mdash;the original and only genuine "Boone's Lick"; Boone's adopted son
Van Bibber kept a tavern there, where Washington Irving stopped some time in
the '30's; it is now reputed a medicinal spring in the little village Mineola, near
Danville, seat of Montgomery Co.</p>

opp. Cuyler's pt., 107&#8531; m. up the Missouri: see L. and C., ed. 1893, p. 9.
This is much the largest tributary of the Missouri thus far reached; Pike elsewhere
allows it 200 yards' width at the mouth, and navigability at times of 100
m. He also notes that the Sac boundary started opp. its mouth: see <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43774/43774-h/43774-h.htm#Footnote_I-14">note<sup>14</sup>,

Missouri on the upper side of the Gasconade; being a mere village or hamlet,
is as appropriately named as the river itself, which got its name from the
way some persons bragged about their exploits when they returned to St. Louis.
Beck's Gaz. speaks of pine which was cut and rafted down, but there has been

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-20" id="Footnote_I-20" href="#FNanchor_I-20"><span class="label">[I-20]</span></a> Pike's map marks no camp for the 26th. The distance between Gasconade
and Osage rivers is exactly 30 m. by the channel. Pike says he goes 15 m.
to-day; I doubt that he went so far if he did not leave the Gasconade till 6.30
p. m. But to take the record on its face would be to set him a mile above
Fisher's ldg., on the S., in the vicinity of the hamlet called Chamois, in Osage
Co. On decamping and ferrying over the Gasconade, Pike first passed the
mouth of Bailey's cr. (Deer cr. of L. and C.), on the S., whence the channel took
him obliquely to Bluffton on the N., 5 m. above the Gasconade. The bluffs
border the river for about 4 m. along here, and at one place in them is the cave
which used to be known as Montbrun's Tavern: see L. and C., <i>l. c.</i> At 1 or
1½ m. above Bluffton the line between Montgomery and Callaway cos. comes
to the Missouri just about opp. the line between Gasconade and Osage cos. on
the S.; this last strikes the river-bottom just where Bailey's cr. also does. At
5 m. above Bluffton is Portland, Callaway Co., before reaching which Pike
passes Little Tavern and Big Tavern creeks, which are a mile apart, on the N.,
and both opp. Portland isl., 2 m. long; while a mile above Portland is the mouth
of Logan cr. On the S. along here is a creek whose mysteries I have never
been able to fathom. This is Rush cr. of L. and C., <i>l. c.</i>, given by them as
4 m. above Montbrun's Tavern, on the S. It is called Greassy cr. by the Mo.
R. Comm., and Greasy cr. by the U. S. G. S.; the latter name is probably correct.
It comes into the bottom in the vicinity of Chamois, about the 121st river-mile
point, meanders down for several miles, and finally discharges behind
Portland isl., somewhere between the 117th and 115th m. of the Mo. R. Comm.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-21" id="Footnote_I-21" href="#FNanchor_I-21"><span class="label">[I-21]</span></a> To an interesting locality&mdash;that of the old French village, Côte sans Dessein,
so called from the celebrated long narrow ledge of rocks of the same name
immediately above, isolated on the N. bank of the river opposite Dodd's isl.
In approaching the Osage, Pike maps two streams from the N., respectively
lettered "Gr. R. au vase" and "L. R. au vase." The first of these
is Grande Rivière au Vase or Grande Rivière Vaseuse of the F., which appears
on the best modern maps as Au Vasse and Auxvasse r.&mdash;better talk English
than such Missouri French as this, and say Big Muddy r., as L. and C. did!
This considerable stream falls in a mile above Harrison's ldg., about 123½ m.
by the channel from the mouth of the Missouri. The other is Little Muddy r.
of L. and C., who translated Petite Rivière au Vase (or Petite Rivière Vaseuse)
better than those do who now style it Au Vasse cr. or Auxvasse cr. This creek
joins in the bottom-land another now called Middle r. or cr., and the two fall in
together a mile above the village of St. Aubert, Callaway Co. Moreover: between
the Big and the Little Muddy there is a third creek, distinct from both
the others, falling in 1½ m. <i>below</i> St. Aubert. This is simply called Muddy cr.
on the Mo. R. Comm. map; on that of the U. S. G. S. it is lettered Ewing's cr.
A branch of this is lettered by the U. S. G. S. East Wing cr.&mdash;a name which I
suspect originated in mistaking "Ewing" for "E. Wing." On the S. side
of the Missouri Pike passes two small streams, both historically notable. The
first of these is the one which L. and C. called Grindstone cr., when they
camped at its mouth May 30th, 1804; but it is now known as Deer cr. It falls
in behind St. Aubert's isl., a mile below St. Aubert station on the Mo. Pac. R. R.,
or the village now called Medora, 126&#8532; m. up the Mo. r. One Carr has or had
his home at the mouth of this creek. The other creek is 4¾ m. above Grindstone
or Deer cr., and 1¼ m. above Shipley's ldg.; it is the one L. and C.
called Bear cr., May 31st, 1804; Pike charted it "Bear R.," and it is now called
Bear or Loose cr. I suppose "Loose" cr. to be a loose translation of F. R. à
l'Ours or à l'Ourse, according to whether it was a he-bear or a she-bear which
the Frenchman who first named the creek killed there. In any event this stream
has given name to the village of Loose Creek and to Bear Creek isl., opposite
its mouth. Four miles higher on the S., opposite the foot of Dodd's isl., is the
village of Dauphine at the place where one Benêt, Bénite, Benoit, Bennet, Bonnet,
Bonnot, or Bennight built his mill, 15-20 years ago. Dauphine is almost
exactly opposite the site of the old French village above named, which started
about 1808 and had a dozen or more families in 1811. There is a sort of settlement
in this vicinity immediately at the lower end of the Côte sans Dessein, at
one time known as Bennet's ldg.; people named Gray, Crews, and Maddox live
or lived there. Behind the Côte are some small lakes or ponds discharging by
R. aux Riveaux or Riveaux cr. (as it is called) around the upper end of the Côte,
near Dearing's ldg. Hence it is only 1½ m. diagonally across the Missouri to
Glenn's ldg. at the mouth of the Osage r. See L. and C., ed. 1893, p. 11.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-22" id="Footnote_I-22" href="#FNanchor_I-22"><span class="label">[I-22]</span></a> Arising in the Ozark mts. of Kansas, the Osage r. leaves that State and
enters Missouri in Vernon Co., which it delimits in part from Bates Co.; traverses
St. Clair and continues past the corner where this, Henry, and Benton
cos. adjoin; traverses Benton, enters Morgan, forms a part of the boundary
between this and Camden, makes a loop through the latter and again separates
it for a short space from Morgan, then for a little distance separates Camden
from Miller, traverses the latter, enters Cole, and finally runs to the Mo. r.
between this last and Osage cos. We shall learn much more of this stream as
we follow it up in Pike's wake. There is a village called Osage City at its
mouth on the west bank; Pike's camp is also on this side, in Cole Co., past two
small tributaries known as Caddy and Sandford's creeks, and not far above
Maries r., which comes from Pulaski through Maries (named for two French
girls) and Osage cos. to fall in on the E. or right (left hand) bank. A Spanish
fort (trading-house) was built about 1795 near the mouth of the Osage.</p>

and Aug. 1st, and that of Aug. 2d (only 2 m. further), are St. Elizabeth, on
Big Tavern cr., and Mary's Home, west of the Osage&mdash;both in Miller Co., but
both some miles away from the river. On breaking camp this morning, Pike
passed on his right the bluffs from which the hamlet of Osage Bluff takes its
name; this is about a mile north of the river. He later passed Babruly cr.,
from the W., whose name is obviously a corruption of Bois Brûlé; then Sugar
cr., from the E., and next Little Tavern cr., falling in from the W. a mile or
two below Big Tavern cr. There was more than one cave or "tavern" in the
bluff near the creek: see figure of one, where the early Osage boatmen used to
put up, in the Mo. Geol. Reports.</p>

camp of Aug. 4th and 5th is marked on his map, on the left, just below the
mouth of his Little Gravel r., which he passes on the 6th: see <a href="#Footnote_I-28">next note</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-28" id="Footnote_I-28" href="#FNanchor_I-28"><span class="label">[I-28]</span></a> On the right hand as Pike ascends, left bank of the Osage, and rather on
the N. than W., as the general course of the river is to the E. The "Gravel"
rivers of Pike require attention in identifying them with ours. The Osage is
here making an ox-bow bend, which reverses points of the compass so far as a
traveler's right and left are concerned. The stream now in question, Gravel r.
of the above text, lettered "L. Gravel R." on the map, is that now known as
Big Gravois, Gravis, or Gravel cr., running in Morgan Co., with a place called
Gladstone near its mouth, one known as Gravois Mills higher up, and some
of whose branches are called Indian, Soap, and Mill creeks. Cape Galena is
2½ m. above the mouth of this river. Present Little Gravois cr. is that one
with Bagnell just below its mouth; it is laid down by an unlettered trace on
Pike's map. The correct form of the word is Gravois, being F. <i>gravois</i>, rubbish,
rubble, whence "Gravel."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-29" id="Footnote_I-29" href="#FNanchor_I-29"><span class="label">[I-29]</span></a> <i>Not</i> the Saline r. of Pike's map, which was passed on the 3d. "Saline
river" of the present text is a slip of the pen or memory; Pike meant to say
Great Gravel r., as correctly laid down by this name on his map on the left or
south, being lettered "G. Gravel R." This is not the Great Gravel or Big
Gravois cr. of present maps, but the considerable stream now known as Grand
Auglaise cr.&mdash;a name also perverted from the F. word <i>glaise</i>, clay, into Glaize
or Wet Glaize cr. It heads in Laclede and Pulaski cos., in close relation with
sources of the Gasconade, and runs about N. N. W. through Camden Co. to fall
into the Osage from the S., on the right bank of the river, on Pike's left, at or
near a place called Blackman's Mills. The Osage is here turning from its E.
course to N., whence it soon bends W., then loops N. and again E., where it
receives present Big or Pike's Little Gravel r., and completes another ox-bow
bend. Camp of the 7th, opposite the notable bluff called "La Belle Roche," is
marked on Pike's map, not far above a place now called Damsel, on the other
side of the Osage; whence the Yungar is reached for breakfast on the 8th.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-30" id="Footnote_I-30" href="#FNanchor_I-30"><span class="label">[I-30]</span></a> <i>Sic</i>, usually in Pike, and I make no change. But "Cheveux Blanche" is a
phrase joining a masculine plural noun to a feminine singular adjective. The
English ed. alters to Cheveu Blanc; but as doubtless the savage had more than
one hair of that color, probably Cheveux Blancs would be better in form and
fact for the F. name of the person also known as White Hair.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-31" id="Footnote_I-31" href="#FNanchor_I-31"><span class="label">[I-31]</span></a> Before the Youngar is reached Pike passes on his left Linn cr.; county seat
called Linn Creek, a mile above its mouth. The name of the river has fluctuated
widely. Pike has Yungar, Youngar, and also Nehemgar; the latest G. L.
O. and U. S. G. S. maps letter Niangua. The word, whatever may be its preferable
form, is the Osage name of the bear, though by some it is said to refer to
the numerous springs at the sources of the stream. It is by far the largest tributary
of the Osage thus far reached; Pike credits it with a canoe navigation of
100 m. The main stream heads in Webster Co., in relation with sources of the
Osage fork of the Gasconade, and runs through Dallas Co., also touching the W.
border of Laclede, into Camden; its tributaries are numerous and widespread.
One called Little Niangua falls in on the W., 6 or 8 m. above the mouth of the
main river. To-day's voyage takes the Expedition past Purvis, and finishes
about 4 m. above Bolinger or Bollinger cr., from the S., on which are the Osage
Iron Works.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-32" id="Footnote_I-32" href="#FNanchor_I-32"><span class="label">[I-32]</span></a> Pike's map marks none of the places passed to-day by the names given in
his text. We have therefore a triple adjustment to make&mdash;of map with text, and
of these with modern geography. This I can do, bearing in mind that Pike
does not necessarily mention places in the order in which they are passed en
route, and that all his mileages are guessed at by the hours spent in making
them. His map marks camp of Aug. 8th a good ways above the Niangua, and
I set it 4 m. above Bolinger cr., as already said. For the 9th the map has: (1)
Big Rock cr., right; (2) Rapids; (3) Slave r., right; (4) camp, right. The
facts in the case are: Pearson's branch, left; Wells' branch, right; Proctor cr.,
right, on which is Proctor; Raney, Rainey, or Rainy cr., left, with Crittenden
at its mouth&mdash;none of the foregoing noted by Pike in any way; then (1) Little
Buffalo cr., right, on or near which is a place called Search; (2) rapids along a
long curved bluff, right, with three little creeks on the left; (3) Big Buffalo cr.,
right, with a place called Riverview at its mouth; (4) camp, right. This makes
about 25 m., barely over the border of Morgan into Benton Co., Big Buffalo
cr. falling in just short of the same boundary; whence it is evident that (1)
Big Rock cr. of the map is (1) Little Buffalo cr., on which is Search; (3) Slave r.
of the map is (3) Big Buffalo cr., on which is Riverview; and this last is the
Upper Gravel cr. of the text. This ends the day, for by no stretch can we get
Pike past Pottoe r. of the text: see <a href="#Footnote_I-33">next note</a> for this.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-33" id="Footnote_I-33" href="#FNanchor_I-33"><span class="label">[I-33]</span></a> Text gives no geography to-day, but the map shows three large streams
between the camp-marks of 9th and 10th. These are: (1) a river, left, lettered
"P. R."&mdash;that is, "Pottoe" r.; (2) Francis r., right; (3) Cardinal r., left.
The facts in the case are: Knobby cr., left, small, at lower point of Williams
isl., large; (1) a large creek, left, falling in at head of Williams isl., called
Beaver cr. on the G. L. O. map, Deer cr. on the U. S. G. S. map, and on
which is a place named Hastain; 2 m. above its mouth is another place
called Duroc, on the S. bank of the Osage; (2) a very large creek, right,
variously called Vermilion, Coal Camp or Cole Camp cr.; (3) a very large
creek, left, called Turkey cr. These three are of the relative sizes and in
the relative positions of the three that Pike charts; so that unquestionably
"P. R." or "Pottoe" r. of Pike's map is (1) the Beaver or Deer cr.; (2)
Francis r. is the Vermilion or Cole or Coal Camp cr.; and (3) Cardinal r. is the
Turkey cr. It is true Pike says his Pottoe cr. was passed on the 9th; but his
map shows otherwise; and if it had been, that is a question of the location of
camp for the 9th, not affecting the identification of the streams here made.
The queer name "Pottoe" I suppose to be intended for Poteau, and not a
misprint for Potatoe: see the name Pomme de Terre or Potatoe for a river further
on. Where Pike got his name Francis r. I have no idea. His Cardinal r.
I imagine was so called by some confusion with Vermilion r.; for cardinal and
vermilion are two names of a red color&mdash;in the one case worn by certain church
dignitaries on their heads, in the other by cochineal insects on their bodies.
Camp of the 10th (and 11th) is 3 or 4 m. above Turkey cr.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-34" id="Footnote_I-34" href="#FNanchor_I-34"><span class="label">[I-34]</span></a> The lacuna of the orig. text can be supplied from the map, which marks
camp of the 12th as above said. On decamping this morning Pike passed what
he charts as Cave cr. This is the middle one of three insignificant runs which
make in on the right. "Vermillion" r. of to-day is a mistake. This is the
stream Pike charts as Deep cr., on the right, immediately below Grand r., and
is that now called Little Tebo, Teabo, Tabo, Tebeau, etc. These are commonly
supposed to be forms of a personal name; but I am informed by R. I.
Holcombe they are perversions of Terre Beau, old name of the prairie in Lafayette
Co. where the "Tebo" r. that flows into the Missouri rises. The Osage
tributary called Tebo, etc., falls in a mile below Grand r.; its E. fork is meandered
for some miles by the Sedalia, Warsaw and Southern branch of the Mo.
Pac. R. R., which then leaves the creek and strikes the Osage 2½ m. below
Warsaw. This is the county seat of Benton, on the N. bank of the Osage, 2 m.
below Little Tabeau cr. and three below Grand r., opposite the very large island
also called Warsaw. Grand r. of the text and present maps is the largest branch
of the Osage passed since the Niangua was left. It falls in on the N., a mile
below Wright's isl. Some of its affluents head not far from Independence (on
the Mo. r.), and others in Kansas. Its largest branch is Big cr.; others are
Deep Water and Big Tabeau. Camp is in the bight of the bend that receives
Grand r., between Wright's and Holloway isls.</p>

<p class="footnote">Pike has mapped the river unmistakably along here, rendering identifications
easy; but the text is not so correct, and requires the interpretation I have
given. The mileages of the 10th-12th seem excessive. Here, as in various
other places, he seems to have supplied the loss of orig. notes from memory.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-35" id="Footnote_I-35" href="#FNanchor_I-35"><span class="label">[I-35]</span></a> In making the circuit Pike passed two rivers which he charts by name as
"Hallico R." and "Potatoe R.," both from the S., or on his left as he ascends.
Potatoe is clearly the same name as Pomme de Terre, by which latter title is
now mapped the large stream which heads in Webster Co., cuts the N. E. corner
of Green, perhaps also the S. W. corner of Dallas, then traverses Polk and
Hickory, and in Benton falls into the bight of the bend of the Osage herein
mentioned. The natives call this river "Pumly Tar." Two miles above its
mouth it receives the Little Pomme de Terre, from the W., in the vicinity of
Fairfield. A much smaller stream, next above on the same hand, which is
received in the same bend of the Osage, is Hogle's cr. The relative situations
of these would make Pike's Hallico correspond to Pomme de Terre, and his
Potato to Hogle's. But I have no doubt he <i>meant</i> by Potato the river now
called Pomme de Terre, and we need not insist upon the reversal of names,
especially as there may be some small stream below to answer to Hallico, and
it would be nothing for Pike to pass over so small a creek as Hogle's, both in
the text and on the map.</p>

Rep. 1845, p. 18: "I had found an old companion on the northern prairie, a

The Park is a narrow, somewhat rectangular loop of the Osage, including some
bold bluffs in its bight. The distance was much under "28" m., unless the
river were then even crookeder than it is now. We have to foreshorten the
mileages along here, in order to bring Pike into anything like the proper position
above the mouth of Sac r. on the 16th. He passes five or six small creeks
to-day, the last and largest being charted by Pike as Buckeye cr. This is
Wright's, from the S., in St. Clair Co. A mile above this is a large island,
which seems to be Pike's Turkey isl.; and a mile above this is another, probably
that on which he camped.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-39" id="Footnote_I-39" href="#FNanchor_I-39"><span class="label">[I-39]</span></a> Pike is still considerably below the present site of Osceola, at the neck of
the last remarkable bend the river makes some 6 or 7 m. (direct distance)
from that town. At present this loop is 4 or 5 m. around and about
a quarter of a mile across at the narrowest part. It receives several creeks
from the N. E., E., and S., the highest and largest now called Bear cr. In
this day's course, which does not include the circuit of the bend, Pike charts
a certain "East River," which he runs in directly from the W. This corresponds
in position with the stream now called Muddy cr., but if meant for that
it is drawn much too large&mdash;half as large as Grand r. itself.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-40" id="Footnote_I-40" href="#FNanchor_I-40"><span class="label">[I-40]</span></a> Several points require attention in this long course, whatever its actual
length may have been. 1. Passing Osceola in the forenoon, Pike reaches his
"Grand Fork," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the confluence of Sac r. with the Osage, at noon. This
is clear, and the distance seems about right from the place where I set his camp
of the 15th. But the streams he charts on this course, below the forks, are not
more easily disposed of than was the "East" r. 2. Thus, on the same side
as "East" r., about halfway from this to the forks, he lays down two small
streams from the W., the lower of which he names Light cr. There are in fact
several such; and it may be reasonable to assume that by Light cr. Pike means
the largest of them. This is the one now called Gallinipper cr., which falls in
a mile below Osceola, and which is now meandered for a few miles by both the
Kansas City, Clinton, and Springfield R. R., and the Kas. Cy. and Southern
R. R. 3. After rounding the bend above described, and passing the Bear cr.
there said, Pike passes two creeks on his left, from the S., one of which he charts
by the name of Lime r. This probably answers to the stream now called
Wablo, or Weablo, or Weaubleau cr. The other one of the two is Brushy cr.
But the identification of Lime r. with Weaubleau cr., and of Light with Gallinipper,
throws both out of relative position, and introduces a difficulty which
can only be done away with by supposing an error of the map. 4. Osceola is
the seat of St. Clair Co., on the left hand going up river, 3 or 4 m. below the
mouth of Sac r. This village is notable as a point up to which steamboats
used to come, especially during our Civil War; it was burned in Sept., 1861, by
"Jim" Lane (James Henry Lane, b. Lawrenceburg, Ind., June 22d, 1814, committed
suicide at Leavenworth, Kas., July, 1866); pop. lately 331. 5. Two
of the little crosses which usually mark Pike's camps are superfluous for the 14th-16th.
One I cannot account for; the other evidently marks the spot where
Bel Oiseau was killed, as there is the legend "Beloiseau Kill'd." Pike usually
calls him Belle Oiseau; but the French noun is of the same gender as the Indian
himself. He was also known as Beautiful Bird. 6. The Sac is about as large
as the Osage at their confluence; it runs on an average due N. course from
Lawrence, through Dade and Cedar, into St. Clair Co. We are told by the
old pioneer "Jack" Beard that the river was so called because a party of Sacs
(probably of the Missouri River band) camped on it about 1820; in the fall of
1861 Sterling Price's rebel army were on this river for several weeks. 7. Camp
is set on the left bank or right hand of the Osage, above Salt cr., right, and just
below the mouth of the stream from the N. called Mine r. in the text, but
lettered "Mire Cr." on the map. This is the Little Monegan, Monegau, or
Monegaw cr.; the place called Monegaw Springs is in the vicinity. (The name
may be preferably <i>Monega</i>, Osage word for "wolf.")</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-41" id="Footnote_I-41" href="#FNanchor_I-41"><span class="label">[I-41]</span></a> Legended "Chouteau's" on the map, where the cross &times; also does duty for
to-night's camp, two miles higher up. The spot can be identified by the coal
bank and shoal mentioned, though the "41½" m. assigned for the day's
journey take us beyond the confluence of the Little Osage, and we see by tomorrow's
itinerary that we are still half a day's sail short of that point. Pierre
Chouteau's place was known in Spanish records as Fort Carondelet, and was
built about 1790 at what is now called Halley's Bluff named for Col. Anselm
Halley. It was an actual fortification with mounted swivels, which Lieut.
Wilkinson speaks of in his Report (given beyond); but it was only maintained
for a few years. The post is twice noticed in the Hist. of Vernon Co., 1887,
by R. I. Holcombe, who informs me that he went over the ground, including
Blue Mound, Timbered Hill, and other places in the vicinity, and that some
old caches in the sandstone may still be seen. 1. In the course of to-day's voyage
the map shows a large stream, unnamed, falling in from the N., on the right-hand
or left bank. This is evidently intended for Big Monegan or Monegaw
cr.; place called Dollie at its mouth. 2. Higher up, on the other side, another
nameless cr. is charted, from the S. This is Beshaw, better called Clear, cr.;
quite large, coming from Barton, through Vernon, past the N. W. corner of
Cedar, into St. Clair Co. 3. Above this, Pike has two traces, both from the N.,
unnamed. One of these doubtless represents Panther or Painter cr., in Bates
Co. Here the Mo., Kan. and Tex. R. R., a branch of the Mo. Pac. R. R.,
crosses the Osage between Rockville on the N. and Schell City on the S. of that
river. These places are 4 m. apart. A mile or two below this crossing the
Osage now forms a circle circumscribing a large round island, nearly a mile in
diameter, which may have been a bend in Pike's time. Several smaller streams
than those just named fall into the Osage on either side, in the course of a few
miles, as Miller, McKenzie, Shaw, Willow, and Lady's. The "10 French
houses" Pike speaks of were opp. the mouth of Lady's cr. (named for one Wm.
Lady). Camp was on the N. W. side of the Osage, near Lady's cr., and thus
in the vicinity of Papinsville (old Harmony Mission).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-42" id="Footnote_I-42" href="#FNanchor_I-42"><span class="label">[I-42]</span></a> A most important point in this itinerary, for here is the junction of the
Little Osage with the main stream, which latter Pike now leaves to proceed up
the former to the villages, and so on into Kansas, etc. He elsewhere says:
"The three branches of the [Osage] river, viz.: the large east fork [<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
Sac r., lying E. of where he now is], the middle one up which we ascended
[<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, Little Osage], and the northern one [<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, main Osage]." The present
confluence is at the point where Bates and Vernon cos. begin or cease to be
separated by the meanders of the Osage; for the Little Osage runs in Vernon
Co., and the main Osage, above the confluence, runs in Bates. There is
a conspicuous mound in the prairie, a short distance S. of this "second fork,"
giving name to Blue Mound township. Both forks head beyond (W. of) the
Missouri State line, in Kansas, in which State the main Osage r. bears the
name of Marais des Cygnes. The "large drift" in the Little Osage which
stopped the boats is marked and so legended on the map, a short distance above
the forks. It seems to have been above the mouth of Muddy cr., which falls in
from the N. within 2 m. of the forks, and was probably about the place where
there is now some marshy ground on the W. side, opposite Horseshoe l. The
latter is a mile long around the curve, and discharges by a short stream into the
Little Osage, from the S., between the forks and the mouth of Muddy cr.
Doubtless it was once the bed of the river. Close by this lake, an eastward
bend of the Little Osage receives a creek from the S.; and beyond this was the
Grand Osage village, close to which Pike established what he calls Camp Independence,
on the E. side of the river, near the confluence of Marmiton or
Marmaton r. This stream falls in from the S., and is rather larger than the
Little Osage; in fact, it forms with the latter the main forks. The Marmiton
receives Drywood cr. a few miles above its confluence with the little
Osage. The name of this river is apparently the F. word <i>marmiton</i>, scullion,
from <i>marmite</i>, pot or kettle; the settlers pronounce it "Mommytaw." For
other features of the locality we may note that the river bottoms are here below
the 750-foot contour line, which represents the general level of the surrounding
prairie; and that there is an isolated mound or butte of 850 feet or more
on the E. side of the Marmiton and close to this river, at the first bend it
makes eastward. The Marmiton is otherwise notable in the present connection,
as Pike's further route goes between it and the Little Osage.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-43" id="Footnote_I-43" href="#FNanchor_I-43"><span class="label">[I-43]</span></a> A letter received from General Wilkinson by this express formed Doc. No. 9

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-44" id="Footnote_I-44" href="#FNanchor_I-44"><span class="label">[I-44]</span></a> Joseph Browne, who in 1806 was first Justice of the Court of Common Pleas
in and for the District of St. Louis, appointed by Governor and General Wilkinson
Tuesday, Mar. 18th, 1806; in 1807 he was Territorial secretary, and
sometimes acting governor. He was succeeded by Frederick Bates, appointed
secretary by Jefferson, May 7th, 1807: see L. and C., p. 1236. The "Babtiste
Larme" of the above paragraph is elsewhere called by Pike "Mr. Baptist
Duchouquette alias Larme." Billon's Annals of St. Louis for 1764-1804, pub.
1886, p. 437, has "Jno. B. Duchouquette, usually called Batiste Lami." Among
the signers of a paper relating to the erection of a Roman Catholic church in
St. Louis, Oct. 30th, 1819, is found "Batiste &times; Duchouquete" (his mark). The
alias occurs in various forms, as Lamie, Lamy, Lamme, etc. J. B. D. was
son of François Lafleur Duchouquette and Céleste Barrois; b. about 1760, d.

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-45" id="Footnote_I-45" href="#FNanchor_I-45"><span class="label">[I-45]</span></a> The village of the Little Osage Indians was about 6 m. higher up and on
the other (west) side of the river of the same name. Marmiton r. falls in between
where the two villages were. These were so well-known to the traders
and others in Pike's time that he does not take the trouble to say exactly where
they were; nor are we favored with the precise location of Camp Independence,
"near the edge of the prairie." But there is of course no question of the
exact site of a village which stood for more than a century: see for example
Holcombe's Hist. Vernon Co. Hundreds of Osages were buried on the mound,
to which their descendents used to come from Kansas to cry over them, as late
at least as 1874. Among the remains rested those of old White Hair himself,
until his bones were dug up and carried off by Judge C. H. Allen of Missouri.
In the vicinity of the upper village is now a place called Arthur, where the
Lexington and Southern Div. of the Mo. Pac. R. R. comes south from Rich
Hill, Bates Co., and continues across both Little Osage and Marmiton rivers;
a mile W. of its crossing of the former, on the S. of that river, is the present
hamlet called Little Osage. All Pike's positions of Aug. 18th-Sept. 1st are in
the present Osage township.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-46" id="Footnote_I-46" href="#FNanchor_I-46"><span class="label">[I-46]</span></a> This census of the Grand Osage village was contained in a letter which in
the orig. ed. formed Doc. No. 12 of the App. to Pt. 2, being a folded table
opp. p. 52, with a tabular "recapitulation" on p. 53. The matter is given
<a href="#orig12">beyond</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-47" id="Footnote_I-47" href="#FNanchor_I-47"><span class="label">[I-47]</span></a> Three letters from Pike to Wilkinson which went by this express formed
Docs. Nos. 10, 11, 12 of App. to Pt. 2. One of them is dated from "Camp

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-48" id="Footnote_I-48" href="#FNanchor_I-48"><span class="label">[I-48]</span></a> So far as the white men are concerned, the party is identical with that which
left Belle Fontaine (see the roster, <a href="#Page_358">pp. 358-360</a>), excepting Kennerman, deserted,
which reduced the privates from 16 to 15, and further excepting the additional
interpreter, one Noel alias Maugraine. (Mr. George Henry, who is left here,
was engaged after the start, and therefore does not affect this count.)</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-49" id="Footnote_I-49" href="#FNanchor_I-49"><span class="label">[I-49]</span></a> By "Grand Osage fork" Pike means the stream on which was the Grand
Osage village, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, Little Osage r. By "fork of the Little Osage" his actual
implication is Marmiton r., near which was the Little Osage village&mdash;though the
phrase happens to be verbally applicable, as the Marmiton is the fork of the
Little Osage r. Pike's course "N. 80° W." at the start would seem to conflict
with the dot-line on his map; but this is simply due to faulty projection of the
streams: see <a href="#Footnote_I-50">next note</a>. Observe also that the course of Sept. 1st is simply a
swing-around to the mouth of the Marmiton, whence Pike revisits the Grand
Osage village. There is no camp-mark for this day; the first <span class="b11">+</span> set is camp of
the expedition of Sept. 2d, before Pike had rejoined his party.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-50" id="Footnote_I-50" href="#FNanchor_I-50"><span class="label">[I-50]</span></a> Which the party had made on the 3d before Pike joined them. Their
camp of the 2d is the first one marked on the map, and this of the 3d is the
second one so marked. This we know from the position marked for the 6th,
just over the divide, and three camps ahead of this of the 3d. Pike is now first
fairly en route. The faulty projection of his map makes him seem to go E. of
S. till the 6th, and then turn W. abruptly. The course of the Little Osage is
practically from W. to E., and Pike ascends it the whole way, having it at
a considerable distance to his right. His trail is over the prairie between the
Little Osage and Marmiton rivers. This is to be particularly noted, as some
have vaguely supposed Pike "followed up the Osage river," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the main
Osage (Pike's "North fork"), and then wondered how he came where we
presently find him. In fact, he goes almost due W. from Missouri over into
Kansas. Camp of the 3d was in the vicinity of the present town of Little
Osage. Gregg's map, on which Pike's trail is traced for the most part with all
the accuracy that the small scale allows, starts him into Kansas too far S.&mdash;a
good way S. of Fort Scott, which is correctly located on the Marmiton.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-51" id="Footnote_I-51" href="#FNanchor_I-51"><span class="label">[I-51]</span></a> Misleading, at first sight; but "Grand river" here means that stream on
which was the Grand Osage village. Pike and Robinson simply took an
excursion of 6 m. to the Little Osage and back to camp, supposed to be 13 m.
from that of the 3d. It was considerably past Rinehart, and probably in the
vicinity of Hoover, a place 2 m. E. of the inter-State line; or perhaps just over
this boundary, which here runs on a meridian of longitude (about 94° 37´).
This vicinity is notable as the scene of the raid of old John Brown in Dec., 1859,
when this extraordinary compound of saint and sinner, whose prophetic visions
of the coming struggle had startling distinctness, killed a man and stole some
negroes and horses. Pike has entered or will immediately enter the N. E.
portion of Bourbon Co., Kas., in the vicinity of places called Hammond, Fulton,
and Barnesville. The two former of these are on the Kansas City, Fort
Scott, and Gulf R. R. I suppose Pike to be about 10 m. N. N. E. of Fort
Scott, the county seat of Bourbon. This is a well-known city, on Marmiton r.,
at the point where Mill cr. falls in. Its military name is a legacy from former
days, the fort having been built in 1842; pop. now about 12,000.</p>

<p class="footnote">From the present station we have to trail Pike clear across Kansas to a point
on the Republican Fork of the Kansas r., just over the middle of the northern
boundary of the State. This is not easy. It would be impossible to do so
with precision, had we only the slender thread of text to guide us. His Indians
took him a roundabout way by the Smoky Hill r. The whole country is flat,
with a complicated river-system; Pike cuts through it, incessantly <i>crossing</i> creeks
and rivers, not one of which does he follow for any considerable distance after
he leaves the Osage basin. The names of the many small towns and stations,
as well as of the small streams, will be recognized by few non-residents.
Fortunately we have the trace dotted on his map, and though this is far out of
drawing for absolute geography, its relative positions are recognizable for the
most part. I am satisfied that the course I lay down for Pike is true to his route
in all its main features. The whole of this Kansan route would be in the Missourian
watershed, were it not for the northward extension of the Arkansan basin
in the drainage of the Neosho and Vermilion rivers. This Pike enters as soon
as he leaves the Osage basin, crosses, and quits before reaching the Smoky Hill:
see the two places legended "Dividing Ridge," etc., on his map. If we suppose,
what I see no reason to question, that his camp-marks are all right, his
marches of Sept. 5th to 17th may be summarized as follows: Sept. 5th, further
up Little Osage r.; 6th, over divide to Arkansan waters of the Neosho r.; 7th,
approaching the Neosho; 8th, across this river; 9th, further along S. of it;
10th, across subdivide of Vermilion river basin; 11th, heading this river, and
across subdivide into Neosho basin again; 12th, across Cottonwood fork of the
Neosho; 14th, further along this fork; 15th, across divide from these Arkansan
to Missourian waters again; 16th, nearing Smoky Hill r.; 17th, across this river.
(Total distance from the Osage villages about 210 m., by Pike's mileages of Sept.
1st-17th about 250 m.) The counties crossed are Bourbon, Allen, Woodson,
Coffey, Lyon, Chase, Marion, Dickinson, and Saline. Further details in
following notes.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-52" id="Footnote_I-52" href="#FNanchor_I-52"><span class="label">[I-52]</span></a> The whole of this way is W. up along the S. side of the Little Osage,
for the most part at a considerable distance from the river, which here has a
northward convexity. But for some miles after leaving Camp Independence,
Pike must have kept pretty close to the south side of the Little Osage, to avoid
the unnumbered mounds into which the country further to his left is broken.
The hill to which Pike came in the forenoon represents a rise from the general
750-foot level hitherto traveled to about 1,100 feet. From its southern slopes,
Mill and Wolverine creeks gather to flow into the Marmiton at and near
Fort Scott; while from the other side some small runs seek the Little Osage.
Camp is in Bourbon Co., somewhere in the vicinity of Xenia, Zenia, or Hay,
a small place near a branch of the Little Osage.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-53" id="Footnote_I-53" href="#FNanchor_I-53"><span class="label">[I-53]</span></a> Pike does not mean that the Arkansaw r. itself is otherwise called White r.,
but the waters of the Arkansaw River basin he has reached are those of a river
called the White, which is perfectly true. He elsewhere calls this Grand r. He
also discusses whether this White r. be a tributary of the Arkansaw or of the
Mississippi, and comes to the latter erroneous conclusion. This White or
Grand r. of Pike is the Neosho; a large stream which waters much of southeastern
Kansas, leaves the State in Cherokee Co., enters Indian Territory, and
falls into the Arkansaw on the boundary between the Cherokees' and the
Creeks' country. Its general course is S. E., then S. Pike lays it down pretty
well on his map, by the name of Grand r., and I find it so charted on various
modern maps. Pike runs it into the Arkansaw all right, and makes its Cottonwood
fork the main stream, out of all proportion to the little creek he traces for
the other fork; but there is not much difference in the two streams, which unite
in Lyon Co. some 8 m. below Emporia. From the vicinity of Xenia, in Bourbon
Co., Pike has to-day continued about W., by or near the station Bayard of the
Mo., Kas., and Tex. R. R., in Allen Co. Having thus headed all Osage (Missourian)
waters, he strikes and crosses the divide, and camps on the head of a
small tributary of Elm cr., a branch of the Neosho (Arkansan waters). I
suppose his camp to be at a point about equidistant from Bayard and two other
places called respectively La Harpe and Wise&mdash;perhaps rather Bayard, La
Harpe, and Morantown.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-54" id="Footnote_I-54" href="#FNanchor_I-54"><span class="label">[I-54]</span></a> The two streams concerned in Pike's approach to the Neosho are Elm and
Deer creeks. Elm is the large forked one which falls in close below Iola,
county seat of Allen. Deer cr. is the next above, falling in about 4 m. above
Elm cr. Pike's map indicates that, after passing some insignificant heads of
Elm cr., he got into its forks, then crossed its north branch near Iola, and
camped on Deer cr., very near the junction of this with the Neosho. I do not
know whether horses can swim in Deer cr.; if not, the only alternative stream
would be the Neosho itself. But the map sets Pike on the east branch of
Deer cr., and there I leave him.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-55" id="Footnote_I-55" href="#FNanchor_I-55"><span class="label">[I-55]</span></a> The Neosho, Neozho, or Neocho r. "A grand fork of the White river" is
ambiguous; but becomes intelligible if we remember that he has just spoken of
the "Arkansaw, alias White river." Pike's ideas of what he calls "White" and
"Grand" r. were not clear. There is no stream in his present vicinity large
enough to be dignified as the "grand fork" of the Neosho itself; we must
understand him to mean the Neosho, as being itself a grand fork of whatever
he meant by "White" r. The Neosho was long and often called Grand r.;
"Neosho or Grand R." is lettered on Gregg's map. Pike never says where
he crossed the Neosho, nor in fact does he inform us that he ever crossed
it&mdash;unless it was when he swam his horses. But that was on the 7th. However
these uncertainties be regarded, two facts are certain: Pike was across
the Neosho on the 8th, and he crossed it between Iola and the town of Neosho
Falls, Woodson Co. I think the crossing was a little above the mouth of
Deer cr.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-56" id="Footnote_I-56" href="#FNanchor_I-56"><span class="label">[I-56]</span></a> West for a few miles, then about northwest, up along the Neosho, but at
several miles' distance from that river, on the dry prairie, and passing from
Woodson into Coffey Co. As to the "second branch" on which is camp:
Pike charts three streams passed to-day, running to his right into the Neosho,
and marks his camp on the third one of these. I take these to be Turkey,
South Big, and North Big creeks; and suppose that Pike camped on the last
of these. It is true that these all three unite in one before falling into the
Neosho; but Pike passed them too high up to observe their connections.
Turkey cr. is practically a separate one, as it falls into Big cr. only about
one-quarter of a mile above the mouth of it; and the connection of North and
South creeks, much higher up, may be implied in his speaking of the "second
branch" on which was camp (Turkey cr. then answering to a first branch).
The single mouth of the three streams here in mention falls into the Neosho
about 2 m. west of Leroy. If it seems rather a stretch to get Pike some
distance up North Big cr. to-day, it may be remembered that the place he
crossed the Neosho was not determined with precision; and that we have to
find him to-morrow, at 11 miles' distance, on a large creek up which he can go
over the divide to the heads of Verdigris r. There seems to be no alternative.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-57" id="Footnote_I-57" href="#FNanchor_I-57"><span class="label">[I-57]</span></a> The total of 12 m. does not agree with the text, which calls for
11 + 4½ = 15½. Eagle cr. seems to have been struck about on the boundary
between Coffey and Lyon cos., where Four Mile cr. falls into it. It is a considerable
stream, which heads in the divide about Olpe (a place on the A. T.
and S. Fé R. R.), is increased by Harper, Hoosier, and other tributaries, and
runs E. into the Neosho a mile and a half above Strawn (a place on the Mo.
Pac. R. R.). To reach Eagle cr. from North Big cr. Pike passed opposite
Burlington, seat of Coffey Co., several miles to his right, and headed the small
Otter cr., on or near which is a place called Patmos.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-58" id="Footnote_I-58" href="#FNanchor_I-58"><span class="label">[I-58]</span></a> It may not be possible to decide which of the several branches of Eagle cr.
Pike went up to the divide. To send him up the main branch, past Olpe, agrees
best with his 21 m. to-day; but in that case he must have breakfasted late.
There is a sharp elbow in his dotted trail, which would seem to indicate that
he made a turn from his former course over the divide. Aside from any questions
of detail, which perhaps could not be decided even by a resident of the
region traversed, we have Pike safe on the headwaters of Vermilion or Verdigris
r. (it has these alternative names on recent maps). It heads in the divide
which Pike has crossed, by numerous small tributaries, several of which Pike
charts. Among them are Haldemand and Tate, heading opposite branches of
Eagle cr., and further on Moon, Rock, Fawn, and Camp creeks. The Verdigris
is of a size smaller than the Neosho, W. of which it runs in an approximately
parallel course; it leaves Kansas through Montgomery Co., enters
Indian Territory, and in the country of the Creek Indians falls into the Arkansaw
8 m. above the mouth of the Neosho. Pike lays it down well, especially the
fan-shaped leash of branches in which it heads, but runs it into the Arkansaw in
common with the Neosho. The Verdigris has of course its proper basin or
drainage within the more general watershed of the Neosho and other Arkansan
as distinguished from Missourian waters. The rim of this basin is the divide
Pike crosses over to-day. He camps on one of the small headwaters, probably
Fawn or Camp cr., in the close vicinity of the places called Elco and Verdigris.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-59" id="Footnote_I-59" href="#FNanchor_I-59"><span class="label">[I-59]</span></a> Pike has headed Verdigris r., and recrossed the brim of its basin into the
Neosho basin again. In cutting off this small segment of the Verdigris basin
he passed from Lyon into Chase Co., "over high hilly prairies," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the
divide, and continued westward till he struck "a large branch of Grand r."
We discover later that Pike takes Cottonwood r. to be the main Grand, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
Neosho r., which I do not see that it is not, though the other one retains the
name of Neosho above their confluence. The stream he strikes is the S. fork
of Cottonwood r. This heads in the same hilly country, by tributaries known
as Little Cedar, Thurman, and Mercer creeks, in relation or opposition to
the uttermost sources of Verdigris r., and flows N. to fall into the main Cottonwood
4 m. below Cottonwood Falls, county seat of Chase. Pike probably
came on this stream somewhere in the vicinity of Baker or Crocker cr., between
places called Matfield Green and Bazar.</p>

<p class="footnote">Cottonwood "creek" was originally so named at the point where it was
struck on the old Santa Fé caravan road, and because it showed the first trees
of that kind to be found in traveling westward on that route. The crossing was
at or near present town of Durham, Marion Co. It was some time before the
true connection of the Cottonwood with the Neosho was made out. At
Council Grove the traders knew they were on a head of the Neosho or Grand r.,
though they called it Council Grove cr. They kept on W. to "Diamond
springs" (on a head of Six Mile or present Diamond cr.), and thence to "Lost
spring" on their "Willow" cr. (a head of present Clear cr., which falls into
the Cottonwood at Marion); the next stream they struck being this Cottonwood
cr., at or near Durham: see a note beyond, where I undertake, perhaps
rashly, to recover the old caravan road in terms of modern geography.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-60" id="Footnote_I-60" href="#FNanchor_I-60"><span class="label">[I-60]</span></a> If Pike bore as much N. of W. as his dotted trail seems to indicate, the
mileage would fetch him on Cottonwood r. about the situation of Cedar Grove
and Cedar Point, which are within a mile or two of each other and of the
boundary between Chase and Marion cos., and about 6 m. down river from
Florence, Marion Co. He is evidently in the loop which the Cottonwood
makes S. E. from Marion to Florence, and then gradually N. E. to the vicinity
of Cottonwood Falls. If the old Kansas Indian trail the map lays down could
be recovered or identified, it would serve to locate him still more precisely.
He crosses the Cottonwood and camps on its left bank. If we attentively
regard the camp-marks of the 12th and 13th, we find them close together, N.
of the Cottonwood, S. of a creek flowing E., and W. of a pair of creeks flowing
S. These requirements are fulfilled, if we take the one running E. to
be Middle creek, which falls in by Elmdale, 10 m. below Cedar Grove; and
the other two, those that fall in together at Marion, 12 m. (direct) above Cedar
Grove. It is true there are several creeks nearer, on the same side, as Silver,
Bruno, and Martin, but these are all smaller than such as Pike usually charts,
and, moreover, he could not go his 9 m. to-morrow in any direction without
getting beyond them.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-61" id="Footnote_I-61" href="#FNanchor_I-61"><span class="label">[I-61]</span></a> Camp in the close vicinity of Marion, seat of the county of that name. The
Indian trail seems to have run past or through Marion. We can confidently
locate Pike within 3 m. of the town on the night of the 13th; and Marion thus
furnishes an excellent fixed point whence to trace him on to Smoky Hill r. The
two streams which unite at Marion, and run through the place as one, are called
Brook Luta and Clear cr.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-62" id="Footnote_I-62" href="#FNanchor_I-62"><span class="label">[I-62]</span></a> Continuing past Marion, up the Cottonwood, which he has to his left,
Pike camps near Durham, Marion Co. This town is on the river, and through
it runs the Chic., Kas. and Neb. R. R. The route seems to have sheered off
from the river a little to the right, more in line with Brook Luta than with
the Cottonwood itself: see <a href="#Footnote_I-63">next note</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-63" id="Footnote_I-63" href="#FNanchor_I-63"><span class="label">[I-63]</span></a> Passing north between Cottonwood r. on his left and Brook Luta on his right,
Pike makes the divide in the vicinity of Tampa, Marion Co. This is a village
on the head of Brook Luta; the railroad last named goes through it, and Pike
crosses the line of this railroad between Durham and Tampa. He is flanking
the higher hills (1,500 feet or more) in which the main Cottonwood heads, by
leaving them to the left or W. This is a somewhat roundabout way from
the vicinity of Durham to that of Bridgeport on the Smoky Hill, where Pike
strikes this river early on the 17th; but it is evident that he did not go straight
between these points, for they are only about 25 m. (direct) apart, and we have
to account for 18 + 13 + 6 = 37 m. on the 15th, 16th, and morning of the 17th.
These mileages adjust themselves to a nicety by the way I make out. I suppose
he crossed the divide between Tampa and Kuhnbrook, Marion Co., thus
passing from Arkansan to Missourian waters, as he says. Kuhnbrook is a
little place on one of the heads of the large Turkey cr., which runs N. into the
Smoky Hill r. opp. Abilene. Rhoades is the next place on this branch of
Turkey cr., and in passing to its vicinity Pike crosses from Marion into Dickinson
Co. He continues on, bearing to the vicinity of Elmo and Banner. These
are places near another head of Turkey cr., and both on the Mo. Pac. R. R.;
they are within a mile of each other. Pike keeps on a piece, westerly, and sets
camp in the vicinity of Carlton, Dickinson Co. Carlton is between the two
forks of Holland cr., next W. of Turkey cr., with which Holland runs parallel
to fall into the Smoky Hill r. opp. Abilene. Carleton is 7 m. due E. of
Gypsum City, which latter is on a creek of that name Pike next strikes.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-64" id="Footnote_I-64" href="#FNanchor_I-64"><span class="label">[I-64]</span></a> Pike camps on a branch of Gypsum creek. This is a large stream which
heads in close relation with the uttermost sources of Cottonwood r., in the
vicinity of Canton, McPherson Co., and flows due N. into the Smoky Hill,
between the mouths of Solomon and Saline rivers. It is larger than either
Turkey or Holland cr., and much branched. It runs about halfway between
Holland cr. and the Smoky Hill, parallel with both; for the latter, having
made a bold sweep from the W., curves N. past Lindsburg and Bridgeport to
Salina, and thence E. to receive first the Saline, next Gypsum, and then
Solomon r. On Gypsum cr. are Chico and Gypsum City, 10 and 12 m. above
its mouth; and Pike strikes it a few miles further up or S. of these towns.
Pike charts its headwaters elaborately, and sets his camps of the 15th and 16th
among the five branches he lays down. Probably one of these should be taken
for Holland cr.; the other four are less easily identified. From his position in the
vicinity of Carlton Pike passes W. from Dickinson into Saline Co., comes first to
Hobbs cr., next upon Gypsum itself and Stag cr., in quick succession; crossing
these three he continues W. to another branch of Gypsum cr., namely, that one
now meandered by the Mo. Pac. R. R. between Gypsum City and Bridgeport.
He camps on the latter, 6 m. E. of the Smoky Hill.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-65" id="Footnote_I-65" href="#FNanchor_I-65"><span class="label">[I-65]</span></a> "We passed it six miles to a small branch to breakfast" is a dubious phrase
which I understand to mean that Pike went 6 m. to a small branch to breakfast,
and then crossed the Smoky Hill r. at once&mdash;at nine o'clock. This crossing
was in the immediate vicinity of Bridgeport, and perhaps at the very place the
Council Grove, Smoky Valley and Western branch of the Mo. Pac. R. R. crosses
to run into Bridgeport. Two insignificant runs fall into the river from the
east within 3 m. below Bridgeport; the first of them is named Pawnee cr.
Crossing the river, Pike proceeds up it, but a little W. of N., and bearing
somewhat away from it; he passes Dry cr., which lower down runs through the
county seat Salina, and camps on Mulberry cr., 2 or 3 m. due W. of that city,
and about the same distance below the point where Spring cr. falls into Mulberry.
This stream skirts north of the city, receives Dry cr., and falls into
Saline r. a mile or two further. Salina is a large place, one of the best known
in the State, where four great railroad lines meet&mdash;the U. P., Mo. P., A., T.
and S. F., and C., R. I. and P. Six or 8 m. due W. of the place where Pike
crossed the river are the Smoky hills, or Smoky Hill Buttes, celebrated in story
if not in song. The great river named from these conspicuous landmarks is
the main southern fork of Kansas r., as the Republican is the northern. Its
uttermost sources are in Colorado. Receiving uncounted tributaries in its
long course, it runs E. in Kansas through Wallace, Logan, Gove, Trego, Ellis,
Russell, and Ellsworth, loops S. into McPherson and out again N. into Saline
Co., makes an elbow at Salina and continues E. through Dickinson into Geary
Co., where it joins its mate between Junction City and Fort Riley, thus composing
the Kansas. Two of its largest branches are the Saline and Solomon.</p>

<p class="footnote">This finishes the first section of Pike's Kansas route from the Little Osage to
Salina. The rest of the way to the Pawnee Republic is northward, crossing in
succession Saline r., Salt cr., Solomon r., Buffalo cr., and White Rock cr.,
striking the Republican r. in Webster Co., Neb., near the S. border of that State.
The distance is less than the 97 m. Pike makes of it. His map is extremely
faulty; he seems to have gone about N. W., though his actual route was very
little W. of N. It also runs Saline and Solomon rivers far apart into the Republican,
instead of the Smoky Hill, magnifies Salt cr. out of all proportion, and
minimizes both Buffalo and White Rock cr.</p>

<p class="footnote">As a bit of authentic history which may interest those in Salina who have
reason to be proud of the growth of their city during one generation, I will
transcribe a passage from my own field notebook, made when I was staging
from Leavenworth to Santa Fe, in 1864: "Sunday, May 29th. Left Junction
City and came to a place called Salina&mdash;three houses and a pig stye."</p>

<p class="footnote">Fort Riley, as above mentioned, was begun by Major Edmund Augustus
Ogden, who had selected the site and was occupied with the work when he died
there Aug. 3d, 1855, in the epidemic of cholera then raging. He was born at
Catskill, N. Y., Feb. 20th, 1810; removed to Unadilla, N. Y., and from there
entered West Point July 1st, 1827; he became second lieutenant of the 1st Inf.,
July 1st, 1831; first lieutenant, Dec. 17th, 1836; was transferred to the 8th
Inf., July 7th, 1838; promoted to be captain, Dec. 1st, 1839; and was breveted
major for meritorious conduct. His first duty was at Prairie du Chien; his
marriage with Captain Gustavus Loomis' daughter Eliza, at Fort Snelling, is
said to have been the first ceremony of the kind between white persons in
Minnesota; he served faithfully and with distinction in the Black Hawk,
Florida, and Mexican wars, and for many years discharged arduous and responsible
duties in the quartermaster department. For several years immediately
preceding his death he was stationed at Fort Leavenworth.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-66" id="Footnote_I-66" href="#FNanchor_I-66"><span class="label">[I-66]</span></a> Saline r., distinctively called Great or Grand Saline, has been already
noted. Pike crosses this, and proceeds to "a small dry branch" of the next
river, to camp for three days. This river is the one he calls Little Saline, and
is now known as Covert or Salt cr., a branch of Solomon r. which falls into
the Solomon 4 m. below Minneapolis, Ottawa Co. Pike's map connects it correctly,
but magnifies its size; for the stream which he passed on returning from
the Pawnee village, and which he lays down as a head of his Little Saline, is
a branch of the Great Saline. Pike probably crossed Saline r. in the vicinity of
Culver, where the railroad now does, then soon passing from Saline into Ottawa.
The small branch of Salt cr. on which he camped was one of several such in the
vicinity of Ada.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-67" id="Footnote_I-67" href="#FNanchor_I-67"><span class="label">[I-67]</span></a> An error is here evident, and I suspect some confusion of the diary of the
21st and 22d. 1. "Distance 11 miles," for the whole 22d, is necessarily wrong, if
m. were made in the afternoon, and this, too, after marching from eight to
eleven in the forenoon. 2. Aside from the fact that there is no branch of the Republican
fork in this vicinity, the map shows that Pike did not reach Solomon r.
till the 23d, and the text of that day confirms this. Camps of the 21st and 22d
were both in the space traversed between Salt cr. and Solomon r., less than 20
m. at the furthest. 3. The difficulty disappears if for "12 miles," etc., of the
above questionable clause, we read "2 miles to the first branch of Solomon
river on our route." This would set Pike on one of the small creeks that fall
into the right bank of Solomon r. in the vicinity of Glasco, Simpson, and Asherville.
A former name of Solomon r. was Nepeholla, used, <i>e. g.</i>, by Gunnison,
P. R. R. Rep. II. 1855, p. 17. Capt. J. W. Gunnison came to the mouth
of Solomon's fork July 6th, 1853, from Westport, Mo., by the Wakarusa River
route, striking the Kansas r. at Fort Riley, crossing there, and continuing
through Abilene; he was en route to the great bend of the Arkansaw by the
usual Smoky Hill route.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-68" id="Footnote_I-68" href="#FNanchor_I-68"><span class="label">[I-68]</span></a> Taking Pike northward across Buffalo cr. I suppose this was crossed somewhere
in the vicinity of Jamestown, Republic Co. In this position the Republican
r. itself is only 5 or 6 m. to his right, and the rest of the journey is simply
following up this river obliquely on about a N. W. course, at a somewhat increasing
distance from it, until he nears it to approach the village.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-69" id="Footnote_I-69" href="#FNanchor_I-69"><span class="label">[I-69]</span></a> To White Rock cr., west of White Rock, a town on the creek and on the
boundary between Republic and Jewell cos. This stream runs east through
these, and falls into the Republican r. opposite Republic City. In getting here,
Pike seems by his map to have crossed several small streams <i>running to his
left</i>, and into a stream he runs into Solomon r. I suppose these to be some
branches of Marsh cr., a sluggish tributary of Buffalo cr. from the N. W.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-70" id="Footnote_I-70" href="#FNanchor_I-70"><span class="label">[I-70]</span></a> Finishing the journey to the Pawnee Republic village, whence the great
river on which it was situated took its name. Its ultimate sources are in Colorado,
like those of the Smoky Hill r. Its main course then cuts off the extreme
N. W. corner of Kansas, by running through Cheyenne Co.; whereupon the
stream enters Nebraska, and skirts the southern border of this until it dips into
Kansas across the N. border of Jewell Co., whence it continues E. into Republic
Co., turns S. in this to Cloud Co., E. through this to Clay Co., and S. E.
through this to Geary Co., where it is joined by the Smoky Hill, as already noted.
The whole journey thus made from the Osages to the Pawnees foots up, by
Pike's distances, about 350 m. In a letter to the Secretary of War he calls it
"375"; but this is simply offhand. He also claims that his Osages led him
roundabout 100 m. through their fear of the "Kans." Pike's land mileages
seem to me more correct than those excessive ones he assigns to his navigation.
I suppose this journey to have been between 300 and 325 m.</p>

<p class="footnote">I must emphasize here the fact that I have failed in every attempt to locate
the precise site of the Pawnee village. One would suppose it well known; I find
that it is not, and have yet to discover the ethnographer or geographer who can
point it out. Correspondence addressed to persons now living in the vicinity
was as fruitless as my exploration of the sources of official knowledge in Washington,
where several friends interested themselves in my behalf to no purpose.
I know of no closer indication than that afforded by Gregg's map of 1844. This
letters "Old Pawnee Village" on the S. bank of the Republican, halfway between
long. 98° and 99° W., and thus, as I judge, about opposite the present
town of Red Cloud, Webster Co., Neb. Gregg runs the Republican entirely S.
of lat. 40° N., <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, in Kansas; but the place where Pike struck it was certainly
in that portion of its course which runs in Nebraska, just over the Kansas line.
Gregg in fact gives his river a recognizable northward convexity along here, and if
it does not overreach 40°, that is a fault of absolute, not relative, position. We
are here much less concerned with latitude than with longitude. The river is running
approximately from W. to E., in Webster Co., and the main point is how
far W. the village was, as that would affect details of the route from the last
point at which I have been able to locate Pike. It will be necessary to discover
the exact situation of the Pawnee village before the cloud over the end of this
journey can be dispelled, and the beginning of the journey from the village to
Great Bend on the Arkansaw can be set in a clear light. For the present I can
only tentatively assume longitude 98° 30´ W. (See <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43776/43776-h/43776-h.htm#Scandia">Scandia</a>, in the Index.)</p>

Aveyron, France, Apr. 12th, 1713, d. Paris, Mar. 6th, 1796&mdash;a philosophical free-thinker
and historian, who wrote too much sense and truth to suit his official
superiors, and was consequently unfrocked. It is a curious fact in the history
of the most Tammany-like machine for the propagation of painful superstitions
ever known in the Western world&mdash;excepting perhaps Brigham Young's similarly
organized scheme&mdash;that whenever one of its members begins to think for himself
they make him take off his gown and wear trousers openly. The irony in
the case seems to escape the professional nurserymen in that hot-house. The
abbé wrote various works; his most celebrated one, to which Pike refers, is:
Histoire Philosophique et Politique des Établissements et du Commerce des
Européens dans les Deux Indes, 1770, repub. 1780-85&mdash;a book whose strength
and other merits may be inferred from the fact that it had the honor of being
burned by Parliamentary order; though its author was simply exiled, the times
being already a little out of joint for roasting heretics along with their
heresies.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-73" id="Footnote_I-73" href="#FNanchor_I-73"><span class="label">[I-73]</span></a> 1. As already indicated, "Tetaus" and "Tetans" are Pike's names for Comanches,
also variously known as Ietans, Jetans, Hietans, Aiatans, etc., and also
by the Sioux name Padoucas, adopted by the French; they called themselves
Num, meaning simply "people." Some of their other names are Kaumains,
Choumans and Comandes; we now write Comanches or Camanches indifferently,
thus adopting a form of the Spanish name, whose meaning is unknown.
These Indians are of the Shoshonean family; they number about 150, on the
Kiowa, Comanche, and Wichita Reservation in Oklahoma; there were some 2,500
when they were placed in a reservation in 1868; they had been noted, time out of
mind, as wide-ranging, lawless, and warlike freebooters. 2. Pike above mentions
three of the four principal tribes of the Pawnee confederation, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, of the middle
group of Caddoan stock, who are: (1) Pawnee proper, Grand Pawnee, or Tcawi;
(2) Pawnee Republicans or Republican Pawnees (giving name to the great branch
of the Kansas r.); (3) Pawnee Loups, Pawnee Mahas, Pawnee Wolves, or
Skidis; (4) Tapage or Pitahauerat: see further, L. and C., ed. 1893, pp. 55-57.
(3) Pike's Kans are entirely different Indians, of Siouan stock, Dhegiha group:
for these see <i>l. c.</i>, pp. 33, 34.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-1" id="Footnote_II-1" href="#FNanchor_II-1"><span class="label">[II-1]</span></a> On the other hand, Lewis and Clark first heard of Pike's expedition on
Sept. 10th, 1806, when they were nearing the Big Nemaha on their way down
the Missouri, and met a boat with a trader bound for the Pawnee Loups: see
L. and C., p. 1206.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-3" id="Footnote_II-3" href="#FNanchor_II-3"><span class="label">[II-3]</span></a> Camp is on one of the tributaries of Rock cr., close to that of Sept. 24th,
if not on the same spot.</p>

<p class="footnote">The route now taken by the expedition is very little W. of S., to strike the
Arkansaw r. at the most convenient point. Thus it diverges westerly from the
route by which the Pawnee Republic was approached, which was W. of N.
The two make a <span class="b11">ᴧ</span> whose legs rest on the Smoky Hill fork at the two points
where this was crossed in going and returning, with the apex at the village.
The main streams crossed between the Republican and Smoky Hill forks are
Solomon and Great Saline rivers. Pike is also on the trail of the Spaniards
who have just raided United States territory to the Pawnees; he marks their
camps, as far as he can find them out, with a <span class="b11">o</span>, to distinguish them from his
own, marked &times;.</p>

<p class="footnote">The party which leaves the Pawnees, so far as the white men are concerned,
only differs from that which left Belle Fontaine by the absence of the deserter,
Kennerman: see <a href="#Footnote_I-2">note<sup>2</sup>, p. 358</a>. The express which Pike dispatched therefore
consisted of some of his Indians.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-4" id="Footnote_II-4" href="#FNanchor_II-4"><span class="label">[II-4]</span></a> This close calculation was doubtless based in part on information Pike
already possessed. We have been told that Malgares started on his raid with
100 dragoons and 500 militia, of which 600 men 240 had been detached, leaving
360. The "large branch" on which was camp was probably one of the heads
of Livingston cr.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-5" id="Footnote_II-5" href="#FNanchor_II-5"><span class="label">[II-5]</span></a> "Distance 18 miles" would never bring Pike to any branch of the Solomon.
His error here is a puzzling one until it is detected by reference to the map.
That sets his camp-mark high up on the same creek, several branches of which
he had on his left when he went up E. of it, Sept. 24th. It is <i>Buffalo cr.</i>,
which Pike erroneously runs into Solomon r., and so seems never to have passed
before. See back, <a href="#Footnote_I-68">note<sup>68</sup></a>. I suppose he struck Buffalo cr. below Mankato,
somewhere in the vicinity of Jewell and very likely between these places. He
seems to be holding about S. S. W., and to-morrow strikes Solomon r. But,
as already explained, <a href="#Footnote_I-70">note<sup>70</sup>, p. 410</a>, precision in this matter is impossible, without
knowing exactly where the Pawnee village stood, so as to have a fixed
initial point of the journey. I understand that there was a certain "Pawnee
trail" once well known from this village to Great Bend on the Arkansaw. If
this be now determinable, it will represent Pike's route with a closer approximation
to accuracy than I have been able to follow it out.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-6" id="Footnote_II-6" href="#FNanchor_II-6"><span class="label">[II-6]</span></a> To the Solomon r., in the vicinity of Beloit, Mitchell Co. The stream
which Pike lays down across his trail of to-day is perhaps Plum cr., which falls
in below Beloit.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-7" id="Footnote_II-7" href="#FNanchor_II-7"><span class="label">[II-7]</span></a> Hiatus in the text, probably from missing or illegible MS.; no course or
distance for to-day. But the map shows a march, and sets camp among the
heads of a small stream. This is perhaps Salt cr., high up, somewhere in the
vicinity of Saltville, Paris, or Victor.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-8" id="Footnote_II-8" href="#FNanchor_II-8"><span class="label">[II-8]</span></a> Perhaps to vicinity of Lincoln, seat of the county so called. The map has
an extra camp-mark, on the head of what Pike calls "Little Saline river."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-9" id="Footnote_II-9" href="#FNanchor_II-9"><span class="label">[II-9]</span></a> In saying that he crossed the (Grand Saline) river "two or three times,"
Pike does not mean that he meandered that stream on his march, but that he or
some of his party were hunting about for the Spanish trail which he was so eager
to follow, and which here became blind. His map marks <span class="b11">o&nbsp;o</span>, the two Spanish
camps he found. His was on the north bank of Smoky Hill r., whose other
name in the text, "La Touche de la Cote Bucanieus," possibly stands for La
Fourche de la Côte du Kansas, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, that fork of the Kansas which runs along
the dividing ridge or coteau&mdash;which is perfectly true of the Smoky Hill fork.
Pike struck the Smoky Hill in Russell or Ellsworth Co. Camp of the 13th is
about on the border of Russell and Barton cos., in the vicinity of Forest Hill
and Dubuque.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-10" id="Footnote_II-10" href="#FNanchor_II-10"><span class="label">[II-10]</span></a> The approximation of Missourian and Arkansan waters is here very close.
The Arkansaw makes its great bend northward into Barton Co., whose county
seat is named Great Bend accordingly. The courses of the Smoky Hill and
Arkansaw are for many miles approximately parallel, and only some 30 m.
apart in air-line distance; the numerous tributaries of each arise all along the
ridge which forms the divide between these waters. Pike has crossed the
divide, and is now on one of the headwaters of Cow cr., a large affluent of the
Arkansaw, which traverses Barton and Rice cos. in a southeasterly course, and
falls in at Hutchinson, Reno Co. His camp appears to have been somewhere
in the vicinity of Claflin, Barton Co., on the Kas. and Col. R. R. The stream
is laid down on his map. It is by far the largest tributary of the Arkansaw
between the Little Arkansaw and Walnut creeks. It was the last stream to be
crossed on the old Santa Fé caravan road before the Arkansaw was reached.
This road also crossed the several tributaries of Cow cr. in the vicinity of
Lyons, Rice Co. One of these, between Lyons and Chase, was called Little
Cow cr. We find another, E. of Lyons, marked on modern maps as "Jarvis"
cr., and given as Charez or Owl cr. in Beckwith's Report of 1853, P. R. R.
Rep. II. 1855, p. 22. Two of these names refer to Don Antonio José Chavez,
who left Santa Fé in February, 1843, en route for Independence, Mo., but was
brutally murdered and robbed in this vicinity, on or about April 12th, by a
party of 15 men who represented themselves to be Texan troops under the command
of one John McDaniel. Particulars of this outrage are given by Gregg,
Comm. Pra. II. 1844, pp. 166-169.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-11" id="Footnote_II-11" href="#FNanchor_II-11"><span class="label">[II-11]</span></a> Walnut (Big or Wet Walnut) cr. is that large northern affluent of the Arkansaw
which runs E. from Lane through Ness and Rush into Barton Co., and falls
into the river 4 m. below Great Bend, county seat of Barton. A branch of this,
called Little or Dry Walnut cr., runs E. from Rush into Barton, and falls into
Walnut cr. about 4 m. from the mouth of the latter. Great Bend is on the N.
bank of the Arkansaw, and thus between that river and Little Walnut cr. The
way in which, and the precise point at which, the Expedition struck the Arkansaw
could hardly be discovered from the text of the 15th-18th; we are not even told
till the 18th that we are on the Arkansaw, as the 15th mostly, and the 16th and
17th entirely, are taken up with the wanderings of the lieutenant and doctor,
who got lost. The key to the situation is not found till the 23d, when it is
luckily recited that a trip was made from the camp on the Arkansaw "about 20
miles to a large branch [or fork] on the right." This is the well-known Pawnee
fork of the Arkansaw, where was old Fort Larned, a noted place, and where
is now Larned, seat of Pawnee Co. So the Expedition struck the Arkansaw 20
m. below Larned, in the very suburbs of the present city of Great Bend. This
locality about the mouth of Walnut cr. became early noted, not only as the
place of northernmost deflection of the Arkansaw, but also as the first objective
point on that river, where the old Santa Fé caravan road struck that river.
It also became the site of Fort Zara, or Zarah&mdash;to be found on some maps as
Fort Sarah&mdash;which was built in 1853 on the high ground between Walnut and
Cow creeks, about 5 m. N. of the road. On July 12th of that year, Capt. Gunnison
reached the great bend by the Smoky Hill route from Fort Riley, having
been preceded in arriving there three days by his companion, who came over
the regular Santa Fé route; Lieut.-Col. E. V. Sumner, 1st Dragoons, and other
officers, arrived from Mexico the same night; and on the spot was camped Captain
and Bvt.-Major Edward Johnson, 6th Infantry, about to build the fort, as
that 100 m. further up the Arkansaw (Fort Atkinson) was to be abandoned.
Col. John Garland of the 8th Infantry passed by in July of that year. Pike's
approach was: Being in camp of the 14th on some head of Cow cr., the Expedition
started on the 15th at noon, and marched five hours, about 15 m., on a
W. S. W. course, thus crossing the Cheyenne Bottoms above said, and coming
to Walnut cr. just above the mouth of the Little Walnut above described. Pike
pointed out a wood and told Wilkinson to go there to camp, while he and the
doctor would go up Walnut cr. a piece to hunt for the Spanish trail. Either
mistaking the wood intended, or finding himself so near the Arkansaw, Wilkinson
went on to that river and camped the party on its north bank, a mile or two
above where Great Bend now stands. Pike and the doctor went shooting buffalo,
and it got pretty late; they returned to where Pike had told Wilkinson
to camp, and found nobody there; so they bivouacked on the spot. In the
morning they went up Little Walnut cr. to search, but did not go far from those
two buffalo they had killed; in fact they got rattled at finding no camp, turned
about and went <i>down</i> Little Walnut cr. to its mouth (which is what text of the
16th means by "their junction"&mdash;confluence of the two creeks). On the morning
of the 17th, being thoroughly alarmed, and imagining that the party must
be higher up the Little Walnut, they started up again, but probably went a
very little way in the rain; for they were overtaken early on the 18th by two
men whom Wilkinson had sent in search of them, and then they were only
"about three" miles from the camp on the Arkansaw. It is not likely they
were at any moment 10 m. from the spot where they had left the party.</p>

<p class="footnote">Pike's map shows nothing but the trail of the party, no camp being marked
after that of the 12th, on the other side of the Smoky Hill r. The trail
makes a sharp elbow at the point where, having come down Cow cr. on the
14th, they turned from that stream on the 15th. Besides Cow cr., three
others appear in succession to the W. The first is Walnut cr.; the second
is Little Walnut, a branch of the first, run separately into the Arkansaw; while
the third is Ash cr., which falls in above camp. Cow cr. is brought in too near
the next one. On the south side of the Arkansaw is marked the station of the
19th-27th, with the legend: "Here we struck the Arkansaw from whence
L<sup>t.</sup> Wilkinson descended the river in skin canoes and Capt. Pike went up by
land with his party." This ends map I. of the Arkansaw, etc., and map II. of
the same connects at this point, the first stream laid down being Pawnee fork,
and the first camp that of the 29th. Camp of the 28th falls between the two
maps, and is not shown. The Spanish trail, which Pike lost on Smoky Hill
r., was all the while a little to the W. or right of the party, and is recovered on
the S. side of the Arkansaw, on the 30th.</p>

<p class="footnote">Pike elsewhere says of his journey from the Pawnees to the Arkansaw that it
was on a general course S. 10° W. 150 m., but might have been made in 120.
His deviation from the most direct route was in bearing a little too far W. to cross
the Saline and Smoky Hill, and then some needless meandering across the divide
to the Arkansaw. But he struck the latter exactly at the right point; for Great
Bend is where the old Smoky Hill and Cimarron route from Leavenworth to
Santa Fé reached the Arkansaw. There was of course nothing on the spot in
Pike's time&mdash;nor was there even in 1864, when I first passed the place, excepting
a miserable shack the stage company had built. The nearest settlement at
that time was Fort Larned. My journal of May 31st, 1864, refreshes my memory:
"At 2 p. m. we brought up at Fort Larned&mdash;mean place, built of adobe
and logs, with a drunken officer in command; everybody half drunk already;
and all were whole drunk by bed-time."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-13" id="Footnote_II-13" href="#FNanchor_II-13"><span class="label">[II-13]</span></a> Pawnee fork is larger than Walnut cr. It runs through several counties on
a general E. course, and falls in at Larned, seat of Pawnee Co. When I was
in the country, 30 years ago, the three principal branches were called Heth's,
Buckner's, and Shaff's. A branch now rejoices in the name of Guzzler's
Gulch. Saw-mill cr. is a long but slight tributary which falls in close to the
mouth of the main stream. Pike crosses the mouth of Pawnee fork on the
29th; the Spaniards had crossed it higher up. He lays it down as a short,
forked stream. Larned is now a city of some importance, and a rival of
Great Bend; it is the natural development of which old Fort Larned was the
germ; it is built mainly on the N. or left bank of Pawnee fork, but has
lately crossed that stream, and also extended in the adjoining Arkansaw bottom.
The locality became noted with the establishment of the Santa Fé trade in the
'20's, and later on was a point of strategic importance in our relations with
hostile or unruly Indians. The main road passed here en route for Santa Fé,
in continuation both of the earliest caravan road and of the later Smoky Hill
stage route; it offered a good camping place, which traders, troops, and other
travelers generally occupied. Another reason for stopping was that the river
was not easy to cross when full. Thus, when Emory and Abert were here, July
13th, 1846, one of Kearny's expressmen, A. E. Hughes, was drowned in it
(J. T. Hughes, Doniphan's Exp., 1887, p. 21). But it varied much; July 13th,
1853, Gunnison and Beckwith found it 20 feet wide, with a fair current, and a
depth of only a foot or two.</p>

cited, particularly as authority for the name wishtonwish (which J. Fenimore
Cooper misapplied to the whippoorwill in one of his novels). The date of Pike's
observation is subsequent to that of Lewis and Clark, but its publication was
prior by four years; both these notices are antedated by Gass, 1807: see L. and

about midway between the latter and the mouth of Pawnee fork. They traveled
on the left or N. side of the river, approximately along the track of
the A., T. and S. F. R. R., passing Dundee station and the small town of
Pawnee Rock; Hubbard cr., on the other side of the river, is also passed, and
camp is set a little beyond it, over the border of Barton Co., in Pawnee Co.
The town of Pawnee Rock takes its name from the remarkable natural object
of the same designation, also sometimes called Painted rock, which was a great
landmark in old times. This is the most prominent point of a sandstone ridge
of notably reddish color and in part scoriaceous; it is about 20 feet high, and
stands off to the right of the road as you go up&mdash;about 2 m. from the Arkansaw
r., before you come to the crossing of Ash cr. It was a convenient place for
the Indians to exercise their pictographic art, and when the road came to be
traveled by the whites the rock was soon covered with inscriptions of names,
dates, and the like. It is about 9 m. by the road from the town of Pawnee
Rock to the crossing of Pawnee fork.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-18" id="Footnote_II-18" href="#FNanchor_II-18"><span class="label">[II-18]</span></a> Passing Pawnee fork and Larned, Pawnee Co., to camp on the left or N.
W. bank of the Arkansaw, about 5 m. beyond. Here is the place where the
old Santa Fé road forked, in the days of the caravans and stages. The main
road followed up the Arkansaw; but the right-hand road sheered off from the
river to take up what was known as the "dry route"&mdash;a sort of cut-off which
looked promising and became a regular stage-road, but was no great advantage
when you had to go slowly and camp out, as the lesser distance was offset by
lack of wood at all times, and of water at most seasons. Having been over
this road, I can certify to the remarks of Gunnison and Beckwith, P. R. R.
Rep. II., 1855, p. 24: "Five miles from camp [on Pawnee Fork] the road
forks ... and one branch follows near by the windings of the Arkansas, to
secure grass and water, while the other appears to push off for a 'short cut' and
'dry route' to Fort Atkinson, near which they again unite on the Arkansas
river; but this appearance is deceptive; for after going a few miles it turns
abruptly southward, and follows but a few miles from, and parallel with, the
other road, keeping it generally in sight, as it does also the trees and sand-hills
upon the banks of the Arkansas river, and is, except in the rainy season, without
good grass and badly watered." The air-line distance of the "dry route,"
from the point where Pike is now to Dodge City, is about 54 m.; the actual
travel is nearer 60. The ground passed over is that sometimes watered by the
Coon creeks, and the road coincides to some extent with that now traversed by
the A., T. and S. F. R. R. Of late the face of the country has been modified
by the Eureka Irrigating Canal, which starts from the Arkansaw at Ingalls, hugs
the river more or less closely to the bluffs below Dodge City, and then starts off
across country in the direction of Spearville and Kinsley.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-19" id="Footnote_II-19" href="#FNanchor_II-19"><span class="label">[II-19]</span></a> Pike camps to-night about opposite Garfield, a railroad station and small
village on the left or N. W. bank of the river. He started up on that side
(having the river to his left), but crossed over on the 30th, and will continue
the whole way to Pueblo up the right bank, having the river on his right.
The general course of the river being from W. to E., its right bank is on
the S., and thus N. of Pike.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-20" id="Footnote_II-20" href="#FNanchor_II-20"><span class="label">[II-20]</span></a> Kinsley, county seat of Edwards, is something of a town in these parts,
situated a mile or two W. of the river on that one of the Coon creeks which
runs oftener than the other one does, and which, when it has any water to discharge,
falls into the Arkansaw at Garfield, after skirting the river for many
miles. The nomenclature of Big and Little Coon creeks is reversed on some
maps. I find that I was camped on one of them, 24 m. from Fort Larned,
June 1st, 1864, under which date my old journal calls it "a puddlesome slough
on the prairie." Thirty years ago it was good buffalo country, and consequently
bad Indian country. A note I penciled June 3d, 1864, runs thus: "Our route
since leaving Larned has been mostly along the north bank of the Arkansaw.
Queer river that&mdash;a great ditch, chock full of grassy islets, stretching through
the treeless prairie like a spotted snake, some seasons so dry you can't wet
your foot in it for miles, and have to dig for a drink, sometimes a raging
flood 200 yards wide. Traveling without military escort is risky. The Cheyennes
are on the rampage; Comanches and Kiowas too." On the 6th, nearing
Fort Lyon, we passed an Indian camp; "it was a band of Arapahoes,
at war with the Cheyennes."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-21" id="Footnote_II-21" href="#FNanchor_II-21"><span class="label">[II-21]</span></a> No mileage for to-day. By Pike's map, camp is at an elbow of the river,
which denotes that curve the Arkansaw makes in passing from Ford into Kiowa
Co. There is no place to name in this vicinity, and the best maps, on a scale
of 2 m. to the inch, do not give any island hereabouts. We will allow Pike
16 m., and set camp in Ford Co., just over the border of Kiowa.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-22" id="Footnote_II-22" href="#FNanchor_II-22"><span class="label">[II-22]</span></a> To "crease" a horse is to hit him with a bullet somewhere along the nape
of the neck, close enough to the cervical vertebræ to stun him by the shock to
the spinal cord, or to the ligamentum nuchæ, yet not to inflict permanent
injury. When this is nicely done the horse falls as if killed, and is roped
before he recovers. But it takes a very good shot, like "driving the nail,"
"snuffing the candle," "barking the squirrel," and other feats of skill which
our backwoodsmen used to practice.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-23" id="Footnote_II-23" href="#FNanchor_II-23"><span class="label">[II-23]</span></a> Since he left Great Bend, Pike has had hilly country continuously on his
left, with only a very narrow river-bottom on that side, in comparison with the
breadth of the low-lying land on the W. or N. In fact, it is this series of
countless thousands of hills and hillocks which causes the deflection of the river
northward, thus making the "great bend." The place where the change occurs,
and where Pike camps, is at Ford, a town in the county of that name, on the S.
bank of the Arkansaw, or rather on the E. and S. bank of Mulberry cr.,
a stream from the S. W., which winds around the town on the W. and N., and
falls into the Arkansaw a mile or so lower down. A branch of the Chic., Kas.,
and Neb. R. R. runs through Ford from Bucklin to Dodge City, Ensign, and
Montezuma.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-24" id="Footnote_II-24" href="#FNanchor_II-24"><span class="label">[II-24]</span></a> Taking Pike past the site of old Fort Dodge and of present Dodge City,
nearly to the boundary between Ford and Gray cos.&mdash;say halfway from Dodge
to Cimarron, and thus about opp. Howell station of the A., T., and S. F. R. R.
Dodge started on the N. bank, but has overgrown the river, and is now built
up on both sides, with two bridges across. Dodge is 17 m. by rail above Ford,
and almost exactly on the 100th meridian&mdash;probably some of the houses are built
on each side of this line of longitude. At or near Dodge were the long-noted
"Caches," of which most of the early travelers speak, but which seem to have
been latterly lost sight of. I cannot locate the exact spot, but it ought to be
easily recoverable by those who have the data I happen to lack. The place
used to be spoken of as near the meridian just said&mdash;though that does not help
us at all, as the maps of those days were mostly 30´ out of the way in longitudes.
Thus, even Gunnison and Beckwith's route-map of 1853 runs the line E. of the
mouth of Mulberry cr. where Ford now stands, and thus about 99° 40´. Gregg's
is much closer than this, though it is on a much smaller scale; his 100th line runs
midway betwixt the mouth of Mulberry cr. and the "Caches." Wislizenus'
route-map, accompanying his report to Congress (Senate Misc. Doc. No. 26,
30th Congr., 1st Sess., pub. 1848) is closer still; for the "Caches" are marked
scarcely W. of 100°. Wislizenus gives us another clew, as he marks "Fort
Mann" at the "Caches." The "Caches" were also about the place where the
dry cut-off, described in <a href="#Footnote_II-18">note<sup>18</sup></a> above, reached the Arkansaw&mdash;in short, everything
points to the immediate vicinity of Fort Dodge as the place where these
caches were located. "The history of the origin of these 'Caches' may be of
sufficient interest to merit a brief recital," as Gregg says, Comm. Pra. I. 1844,
p. 67, where, and on p. 19, we have the account. In 1812 was fitted out the
first expedition which attempted to reach Santa Fé by following the account of
Pike's journey now before us. This consisted of about a dozen men, among
them two named Beard and Chambers, who had succeeded in reaching Santa Fé
with the others, and had returned to the United States in 1822 (Chambers had
done so by way of the Canadian r.). These two interested some St. Louis
capitalists to join an enterprise in the Santa Fé trade, and then undertook to
return to Santa Fé in the fall of 1822 with a small party and an assortment of
merchandise. "Reaching the Arkansas late in the season, they were overtaken
by a heavy snowstorm, and driven to take shelter on a large island. A rigorous
winter ensued, which forced them to remain pent up in that place for three long
months. During this time the greater part of their animals perished; so that,
when the spring began to open, they were unable to continue their journey with
their goods. In this emergency they made a <i>cache</i> some distance above, on the
north side of the river, where they stowed away most of their merchandize.
From thence they proceeded to Taos, where they procured mules, and returned
to get their hidden property. Few travelers pass this way without visiting these
mossy pits, many of which remain partly unfilled to the present day."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-25" id="Footnote_II-25" href="#FNanchor_II-25"><span class="label">[II-25]</span></a> Alluding to the terrible defeat of General Arthur St. Clair's army by Indians
on a branch of the Wabash r., in present Darke Co., Ohio, Nov. 4th, 1791.
This was the most disastrous battle ever lost by the whites to the Indians, surpassing
Braddock's defeat on the Monongahela in 1755. On Dec. 25th, 1793,
General Anthony Wayne, who had become commander-in-chief in 1792, and
taken command of the Army of the West, sent a detachment of soldiers to take
possession of the field where General St. Clair had been defeated, built a fort
there, and named the place Recovery, because it was then first recovered from
the Indians, who had retained possession after the disaster above named. June
29th, 1794, General Wayne sent troops with supplies to Fort Recovery from
Greenville, where he was then stationed. The detachment reached the fort and
deposited its supplies in safety, but was immediately attacked, and the fort
itself was invested by Indians, assisted by whites from Canada. The battle
raged June 30th and July 1st, when the assailants were repulsed, not without
great loss on our side. Among those who fell was the gallant McMahon, who
had commanded the expedition to Fort Recovery. For further information see:
Howe's Hist. Coll. Ohio, under head of Darke Co.; Burnet's Notes of the
N. W. Terr., chap. vii; Albach's Annals of the West, p. 642. Present Fort
Recovery is a village in Mercer Co. O., on a branch of the Wabash r., close to
the Indiana State line.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-26" id="Footnote_II-26" href="#FNanchor_II-26"><span class="label">[II-26]</span></a> Camp past Cimarron and Ingalls, but not far W. of the latter&mdash;5 m., perhaps.
These are two towns on the N. bank, respectively 18 and 26 m. above
Dodge City. Ingalls is the seat of Gray Co. The Amer. Sp. word <i>cimarron</i>
means something wild, runaway, or unreclaimed, like <i>maroon</i>, and is applicable
to an animal, a person, a place, etc. It designated the wild sheep of the Rocky
Mountains (<i>Ovis montana</i>), gave name to one of the largest branches of the
Arkansaw, and was early associated with a certain route from the Arkansaw to
Santa Fé. The name of J. J. Ingalls was long prominent in Kansas politics
and in national statesmanship, and at one time associated with the too-true
statement that "purity in politics is an iridescent dream." Notwithstanding
the injunction against truth-telling which the consequences of the scholarly
senator's remark imply, I wish to speak as accurately as possible regarding the
points at which the Cimarron route left the Arkansaw. There were two of
these places, both of which Pike passes to-day, where the river was forded, and
the road thus crossed from the N. to the S. bank. These became known as the
Lower and Upper Crossings of the Arkansaw; they were 8 m. apart; the
lower one was 18 m. and the upper one 26 m. above Fort Atkinson; they thus
correspond to the positions of Cimarron and Ingalls, respectively. The river is
now bridged at each town. The Lower Crossing was the earlier one, most used
by the traders from 1834 till the closing of the Mexican ports in 1843; after
the war the Upper Crossing seems to have been generally chosen. Thus, we
find Gunnison and Beckwith saying in 1853, P. R. R. Rep. II. 1855, p. 26:
"Seventeen miles from the fort [Atkinson] there is a ford, sometimes used by
the trains and parties going to and from New Mexico by the Cimmaron [<i>sic</i>]
route; but the principal ford for that route is 8 m. above this." Writing of
1846, Dr. Wislizenus speaks of moving "about 20 miles" up the Arkansaw
from the Caches, and arriving "at the usual fording place," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the lower one.
"This track," says Gregg, Comm. Pra. I. 1844, p. 311, "which has since
remained permanent, was made in the year 1834. Owing to continuous rains
during the passage of the caravan of that year a plain trail was then cut in the
softened turf, on the most direct route across this arid desert, leaving the
Arkansas about 20 miles above the 'Caches.' This has ever since been the
regular route of the caravans; and thus a recurrence of those distressing sufferings
from thirst, so frequently experienced by early travellers in that unhospitable
region, has been prevented." The first camp S. of the Arkansaw was
usually made in the vicinity of the Sand Hills, at a place called the Battleground
after 1843, in which year the defeat of the Mexicans by the Texans
under Colonel Snively occurred on that spot; it was some 12-15 m. from the
river. The roads from the two fords came together at no great distance from
the Arkansaw (perhaps in the vicinity of Ulysses, seat of Grant Co.); having
thus headed the Crooked Creek branch of Cimarron, the road crossed Sandy cr.
not far above its confluence with the Cimarron, and so reached that river.</p>

road had been "on the outside" of the party, Pike gives us to understand that
it had run along to his left, a little further from the river, though since the 30th
of Oct. he had been also traveling on the S. side of the Arkansaw, having
that river on his right. Nevertheless, the map marks the two trails as identical,
the Spanish camps alternating with the American all along. There has been
little to note along this stretch of the river, where no stream of any consequence
falls in on either side. Pike here remarks a change, in the beginning of hilly
country; extensive sand-hills are skirting the river on the S., in Kearney Co.,
and thence into Hamilton.</p>

expecting then to hark back, much as usual, and make the requisite adjustments
of camps by proportionate lengths of each. But I find no occasion for
this; his own mileages fix his camp of the 11th as nearly as possible on the

station of the A., T., and S. F. R. R. Below this are some small runs on the
N., among them one called Cheyenne cr.; and Wild Horse cr. falls in on that
side a mile above Hollys. He then crosses Two Butte cr., a much larger
stream, from the S., arising in Las Animas Co. about the elevations from
which it takes name, running through the N. W. corner of Baca and traversing
Prowers to fall in a mile above the mouth of Wild Horse cr., opposite the large
island there. Continuing, Pike crosses Granada cr., from the S., which falls in
where the railroad crosses the Arkansaw and runs into the station named Adana.
If he held straight on the best road, keeping to the left of the extensive bottoms
along here, he went through the present sites of Granada, a village 4 m. W. of
Adana, on Wolf cr., and of Manville, a station 2 m. further along. Camp was
set about halfway between Manville and Carlton, a place 4 m. beyond. Several
runs or washes make in along here on each side, but seldom carry as much
water as the ditches which have been brought from the Arkansaw through
and by Granada. Pike charts Two Butte cr., and one that answers either to
Granada or Wolf cr.: notice the pair he lays down, S., with the legend "Cotton
Wood becomes frequent" lettered across Two Butte cr.</p>

<p class="footnote">The Wild Horse cr. above mentioned appears on Gregg's map by the name
of "Lit. Sand Cr."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-33" id="Footnote_II-33" href="#FNanchor_II-33"><span class="label">[II-33]</span></a> No mileage to-day; and the omission is not easily supplied. On the 15th
Pike camps at the mouth of Purgatory r., and it took him 34 m. by his reckoning
to get there from his camp of the 13th. Therefore, camp of the 13th was
about 12 m. from that of the 12th, and thus within a mile or two of Lamar. I
shall so suppose it to have been. This sets Pike past the "point of red rocks
and one large [Big Sandy] creek," which he speaks of as having passed on the
14th, but it agrees with the map, which sets a camp-mark for the 13th past
Big Sandy cr. There is evidently a confusion of the record of the 13th and
14th, perhaps in the flurry of the Indian sign; all things considered, I shall
set camp of the 13th, hypothetically, 2 m. short of Lamar: and that of the
14th at the station Prowers, 10 m. further; whence it is about 24 m. for the
15th to Purgatory r. The points passed on the 13th and 14th are most conveniently
discussed together: see <a href="#Footnote_II-34">next note</a>. The site of Fort Aubrey (named
for or by F. X. Aubrey?), on the N. bank, was probably passed on the 13th.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-34" id="Footnote_II-34" href="#FNanchor_II-34"><span class="label">[II-34]</span></a> From his camp of the 12th Pike passes the village and station Carlton, opposite
which the small Cottonwood cr. falls in from the N., and proceeds to his
own "large creek" and "point of rocks." This stream is Big Sandy cr., from
the N.; Pike lays it down very well. It is quite a river or river-bed, which
when it runs drains from the high country known as the Arkansaw Divide, <i>sc.</i>
between Arkansan and Missourian waters, in El Paso, Elbert, and Lincoln cos.
The stream further traverses Cheyenne and Kiowa cos., and seeks the Arkansaw
in Prowers Co., 2 or 3 m. below the point of rocks Pike notices. This is
a place where a bold headland abuts against the river on the south, rising rapidly
from 3,575 to more than 3,800&mdash;that is, some 300 feet above the general level
of the river bottom. A run known as Clay cr. comes around the bluff on the W.
The next above is Willow cr., S., on which Lamar stands between irrigating
ditches derived from the Arkansaw, and the next above is Dry cr., S., halfway
between Lamar and Prowers station. Here is camp of the 14th, just over the
border of Prowers, in Bent Co. Pike's map legends "Broken with small
Ravines &amp; Creeks" on the country passed over.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-35" id="Footnote_II-35" href="#FNanchor_II-35"><span class="label">[II-35]</span></a> This statement conflicts with Pike's map, which lays down only one stream
between the two camp-marks that stand for the 14th and 15th. But the text
is right, and <i>both</i> these camp-marks are misplaced. One belongs just below
Mud cr., and the other at Purgatory r., where there is no sign of one, though
this is the most exactly locatable station since we left Great Bend. Pike's
"two deep creeks" are Mud and Caddoa; his "many points of rocks" appear
on any good topographical map. There is a series of such between Prowers
and Mud cr., on the S., opposite which Graveyard cr. falls in, N. Two very
notable points of rocks, a mile apart, are separated by Caddoa cr.; and
Limestone cr. falls in from the N., 2 or 3 m. below these. These bluffs extend
to the village of Caddoa, 2 m. up, in a bottom left by their recession from
the river, before they again close in on the river in two bold headlands, 1 or 2
m. above Caddoa. The country on the N., across the river, is also bluffy for
several miles along here. The elevations close to the river are 3,800 to 3,900
feet, and higher further back on both sides. Above the Caddoan bluffs a
creek which Pike charts falls on the S. This is lettered Blue cr. on late G. L.
O. maps, and Rule cr. on those of Hayden and Powell. Caddoa cr. heads
about the N. W. corner of Baca Co., and takes a northerly course to the Arkansaw;
Blue or Rule cr. is the larger one of the two; some of its affluents
are near those of Caddoa and upper reaches of Two Butte cr., about Shell Rock
cañon in Baca Co., but its real source is further south in Las Animas Co.,
where Johnny cr. and others head. Its course is northerly, but with an eastward
trend, about parallel with Purgatory r. About an hour before Pike
reached this large river he passed opposite the place where Fort Lyon was later
built, on the bluff around which the Arkansaw there sweeps closely. In 1864
Lyon was the first inhabited place on the Arkansaw west of Larned, though
there had been trading-posts or certain other temporary dwellings at various
points, especially at the upper end of the Big Timbers, say 12 m. E. of Fort
Lyon. These were a large body of cottonwoods extending thence several miles
down the river on its N. side, and formed a noted resort of various Indian
tribes. Hence the woods became well known to travelers along the Arkansaw,
whose itineraries almost always speak of the "Big Timbers" as they approach
the Purgatory on their way to Bent's fort. Pike's text of the 13th is no doubt
the earliest indication of these woods.</p>

<p class="footnote">Gregg's map lays down three large creeks from the S. between his Big Sand
cr. and Purgatory r. The first of these is called Mulberry; the other two are
nameless. The three appear to correspond to the Mud, Caddoa, and Blue creeks
just described.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-36" id="Footnote_II-36" href="#FNanchor_II-36"><span class="label">[II-36]</span></a> The main chain of the Rocky mts., with Pike's Peak towering to the
right: see L. and C., ed. 1893, p. 328. Pike has before him the Front range
of the Rockies, northward, or to the right; and southward, or to the left, the
Sangre de Cristo range. The sources of Arkansan waters are between these;
while on the other side of the last named range are those of the Rio Grande.
The "cheers to the Mexican mountains" were given at an alt. of 3,900 feet.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-37" id="Footnote_II-37" href="#FNanchor_II-37"><span class="label">[II-37]</span></a> Purgatory r., also called in English Picket-wire, in French Rivière Purgatoire,
and in Spanish Rio Purgatorio and Rio de Las Animas, is charted by
Pike as the "1st Fork," with the legend "Here the Mountains are first seen."
This very large branch or fork of the Arkansaw heads in that southward continuation
of the Sangre de Cristo range which is known as the Culebra range,
about Trinchera, Culebra, and other peaks, where it connects with sources of
the Rio Culebra, a tributary of the upper Rio Grande. Its own tributaries are
very numerous and extensive. The main river runs N. E. from Las Animas
Co., through the S. E. corner of Otero Co., and joins the Arkansaw in Bent Co.,
between the site of Fort Lyon and that of Las Animas, present county seat of
Bent. Pike camped where the railroad now crosses; and his journey since the
12th has been practically along the present railroad line.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-38" id="Footnote_II-38" href="#FNanchor_II-38"><span class="label">[II-38]</span></a> It is certain that Pike was on Purgatory r. on the 15th, and certain
that he did not reach his "Grand Forks" (present site of Pueblo, at junction
of Fountain r.) till evening of the 23d. The distance between these points,
along the river, is between 90 and 100 m. Pike's ostensible mileages are: for
the 16th, 11½; 17th, 23½; 18th and 19th, none; 20th, 18; 21st, 21; 22d,
17; and 23d, 19; total, 110 m. We have, therefore, to reduce these mileages
by about one day's journey. Observe, also, that only <i>four</i> camps are marked
for the 16th-22d; there should be <i>five</i>, and with that for the 23d, <i>six</i>. Thus
the text and map do not agree, and some error is evident, though what it is we
have no means of deciding with confidence. I am inclined to think that the
difficulty lies at the start from the "1st Fork" (Purgatory r.), when so much of
the day was occupied in searching for the Spanish trail, and the "11½" m.
assigned may have been little if any actual advance. If we proceed upon this
supposition, there will be no trouble in adjusting mileages to bring in the
missing camp by the 20th; after which all possible error is removed by the
identifiable points. I shall, therefore, set camp of the 16th scarcely above the
mouths of Adobe and Horse (formerly Dry) creeks, which fall in close together
on the north, 7 and 8 m. above Purgatory r. Neither of these is noticed by Pike,
though each is larger than some of the streams he charts. But they were across
the river, and Pike had a bad case of Spanish trail on the brain, aggravated by
anxiety about Indian sign.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-39" id="Footnote_II-39" href="#FNanchor_II-39"><span class="label">[II-39]</span></a> The mileage hardly requires any adjustment, from the position I have
assigned for the 16th, to set camp of the 17th in the close vicinity of Rocky
Ford, a village and station on the railroad, where Pike remains on the 18th and
19th. Rocky Ford is 5 m. above Timpas cr. (which he charts as the first
stream from the left above his "1st Fork"). Timpas or Timpa is a large
creek which heads in Las Animas Co. and runs N. N. E. into the Arkansaw at
the upper point of that very large island above La Junta.</p>

<p class="footnote">The most notable point passed to-day is the historic site of Bent's old fort, on
the N. bank of the Arkansaw, 7 or 8 m. E. of the Timpas. It was a position
of great consequence in the days of staging from Fort Leavenworth and other
points on the Missouri to Taos, Santa Fé, and other New Mexican places.
Most of the early itineraries, both commercial and military, speak of Bent's fort,
and the advantages of this location for a post were more than once urged upon the
attention of the War Department. It was on an emigrant road, in the heart of
an Indian country overrun with various tribes; was a sort of focus for several
widely divergent termini; was in the vicinity of good building material, and had
plenty of fuel, grass, and water. Mr. Bent himself destroyed it in 1849, when
he abandoned it for sufficient reasons; but some of the chimneys and adobe
walls long stood to mark the spot. Thus it was Bent's "old" fort when I
passed by, about 30 years ago. Gregg's, Wislizenus', and in fact most maps of
the period mark the fort, some of them giving also a certain Fort William
alongside it. The structure is described as "quite complete" by Lieut. J. W.
Abert, who was here in August, 1846, at which time he met such noted plainsmen
as Capt. Walker of California renown, Marcellus St. Vrain, and "Bill"
Garey. Col. Price's regiment was here about the same time. The several
columns of Gen. S. W. Kearny's Army of the West, which invaded and subjugated
New Mexico and California, coming from Fort Leavenworth by the
Arkansaw route, concentrated in camp a few miles below the fort, Aug. 1st,
1846. Kit Carson knew the place well, and Frémont found him not far
away from here in July, 1843. A view of Bent's fort as it appeared in 1846 is
given by John T. Hughes, in his admirable Doniphan's Expedition, 8vo, Cincinnati,
1847, p. 35. The old route into Santa Fé left the Arkansaw close by
Bent's fort, went S. W. between Purgatory r. and Timpas cr., struck the latter
at a place then as now called Iron Springs, and so on through the Raton
mts., not very different from the way the A., T., and S. F. R. R. now takes.
A glimpse at the kind of a road this used to be is had from the following extract
from my diary: "<i>Tuesday, June 7th, 1864.</i> Bent's old fort. Cold ride in
the rain from 3 a. m. to 5 p. m., when we brought up at the fort. Here was
our crossing of the Arkansaw. Recent hard rains made the river unfordable;
so we had to ferry ourselves over the surging tide in a frail skiff&mdash;ticklish business.
However, we got safe across, with all our worldly goods&mdash;the latter
nothing to speak of, and stood shivering while the ramshackled hack that met
us on the other side was loaded and hitched up. This storm and the ferriage
began a series of mishaps that reached to Fort Stanton in New Mexico, and
made the driver swear that 'the grace of God had petered out on the other side
of the Arkansaw.' Kept on to Iron Springs; road miry, pace snaily."</p>

<p class="footnote">The name of Bent's Fort is preserved as that of a place nearly opposite (a little
above) the present station Robinson, which latter is exactly on the boundary
between Bent and Otero cos. Above this is La Junta, on the S., seat of the
county. Several creeks fall in on the S. along here, the largest one of them
named Crooked cr.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-40" id="Footnote_II-40" href="#FNanchor_II-40"><span class="label">[II-40]</span></a> Taking the Expedition just beyond the mouth of the Apishapa, Apishipa,
or Apishpa r., to the present station Rockdale. This stream is charted by
Pike; <i>a camp-mark is set just above it</i>, assuring us that the difficulty we had
is already adjusted. It is a large river, or rather a long-bedded water-course
(like many others which start well, but run out in the thirsty soil), heading
about the Spanish Peaks, and reaching the Arkansaw at the foot of Apishapa
bluffs (4,675 feet), between Rockdale and Catlin. Three miles off, across the
Arkansaw, is the station Olney of the Mo. Pac. R. R., which here comes to
the river. In old days a point opposite the mouth of the Apishapa was a good
camp on the Cherokee trail to the gold-diggings on Cherry cr., with the Huerfano
mountains and Spanish Peaks in sight.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-41" id="Footnote_II-41" href="#FNanchor_II-41"><span class="label">[II-41]</span></a> To a point on the river, in Pueblo Co., between Nepesta and the Huerfano,
short of which river Pike's camp-mark is set. Pike charts the Huerfano
as his "2nd Fork." We also notice that he marks <i>two</i> Spanish camps, <span class="b11">o&nbsp;o</span>, for
the day's march, as called for by the text, though they are by no means set
down "within three miles of each other." Nepesta is only a hamlet and station,
but serves to mark a well-known crossing of the Arkansaw. The A., T.,
and S. F. R. R. now crosses here, meeting the Mo. Pac. R. R., and the two
tracks run together into Pueblo. The Huerfano is a great river, which heads
in the Sangre de Cristo range, among the mountains of the Sierra Blanca range,
and by various other affluents, as Muddy cr. and others, heading in the very
passes of the Sangre range which we shall have to discuss when Pike's forlorn
and frostbitten party reaches them. Some other tributaries drain from the
W. side of the Wet mts. The union of these in Huerfano Park starts
the river out of the mountains by Huerfano pass; in the plains it receives
Cucharas r., a tributary of nearly equal size, from further S., and their
united stream seeks the Arkansaw on a N. E. course. A place called Jackson
is on the river near its mouth; opposite, across the Arkansaw, is Booneville.</p>

<p class="footnote">The place above mentioned by the name Nepesta reminds me to say that
Rio Napeste was a Spanish name of the Arkansaw r. itself, at least in its upper
or Colorado reaches. One of Pike's own maps letters "Rio de Napesi," a
phrase reappearing as "Rio de Nanesi" on Lewis and Clark's map of 1814;
and yet other forms of the name occur. The phrase is obviously Spanish, but
the word itself I do not recognize as such&mdash;very likely it is derived from the
Ute Indian language. Humboldt's map letters "Rio de Napestle."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-42" id="Footnote_II-42" href="#FNanchor_II-42"><span class="label">[II-42]</span></a> The "front only," a phrase italicized in the original, means that only the
vanguard of the army met the insolent Pawnees. This probably consisted of
Pike, Robinson, and Vasquez; the rest of the invading forces, being 13 rank
and file, main column and rearguard combined, having not yet come up to
engage the enemy.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-43" id="Footnote_II-43" href="#FNanchor_II-43"><span class="label">[II-43]</span></a> The Huerfano (Orphan) r., marked "2nd Fork" on Pike's map, is passed
to-day without remark&mdash;no doubt Pike was thinking more of Pawnees than of
geography. In consequence of the fracas, little progress was made; probably
less than 17 m., as we see by the mileage assigned to the 23d. Camp can be
set little if any beyond the site of old Fort Reynolds, which stood on the S.
bank of the river, about opposite the mouth of Black Squirrel or Chico cr.
This falls in from the N., on a course parallel with that of Fountain r.; it arises
by several heads in the Arkansaw divide, N. E. of Colorado Springs, opposite
heads of Kiowa and Bijou creeks (branches of the South Platte); at its mouth
is Chico sta. (Nyburg), on the N. side of the Arkansaw, 12 m. E. of Pueblo.
Nearly opposite the mouth of the Huerfano is Booneville; this locality used to
be a regular camping-ground on the old Cherokee trail, and here was a ford
across the Arkansaw, opposite Charles Audebee's (or Autobee's) house.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-44" id="Footnote_II-44" href="#FNanchor_II-44"><span class="label">[II-44]</span></a> Pike's Third Fork, charted "3d Fork," is the San Carlos or St. Charles r.
His Grand Forks is the confluence of Fountain r. with the Arkansaw, at
present city of Pueblo&mdash;perhaps the best known place where we have found
him since the Expedition started. The Charles arises in the Wet mts., where
also heads its main branch, called Greenhorn r., as in fact the Charles itself
often used to be. Their streams unite in the prairie 8 m. S. of Pueblo, and
fall into the Arkansaw 7 m. E. of that city, or about halfway to Fort Reynolds.
It was in this vicinity that the old Cherokee trail forked, the right-hand road
taking up toward the gold diggings, while the other kept on to Pueblo. The
Greenhorn mt., about which the San Carlos heads, has an ascertained altitude
of 12,230 feet. Fountain r. is still called Fontaine r. by those who prefer
French to English, and used to be more elaborately styled La Rivière de la
Fontaine qui Bouille, River of the Boiling Spring&mdash;not that the water is hot,
but that it bubbles as it wells out of the rocks, as if it were boiling. "This
spring," says Marcy, Pra. Trav. 1859, p. 300, "or, rather, springs, as there are
two, both of which boil up out of solid rock, are among the greatest natural
curiosities that I have ever seen. The water is strongly impregnated with salts,
but is delightful to the taste, and somewhat similar to the Congress water."
But before General Marcy's time the springs had become noted. On the 17th
of July, 1843, they were visited by Frémont, who describes them at length in
his Rep., orig. ed. 1845, p. 117; Mr. Charles Preuss, of his party, thought the
water resembled that of the Seltzer Springs in the Grand Duchy of Nassau.
About nine-tenths of the solid matters in solution is chalk. When I was at
Manitou Springs, a few years ago, it was a common sight to see people in the
electric cars with bottles of the water, which had already become an extensively
advertised commercial article. Fountain r. has also its Spanish name of Rio
Almagre or Almagra, meaning red ocher or other reddish earth. It is formed
of two main courses which head about Pike's Peak and other elevations of the
same outlying (Front) range of the Rockies, called respectively Fountain and
Monument cr.; these unite at Colorado Springs. Monument cr., coming
southward in the foothills, is composed of various others, called Beaver, Dead
Man's, West Monument, Crystal, etc. Fountain cr., which comes eastward
from Pike's Peak itself and that vicinity, seeks the plains by the villages of
Manitou Springs and Colorado City, and the city of Colorado Springs (seat of
El Paso Co.)&mdash;for such are the respective designations of these places, now
well known to tourists and especially valetudinarians. At Manitou Springs it
receives Ruxton cr., through Ingleman cañon, now traversed by the cogwheel
Manitou and Pike's Peak R. R.; item, it receives Glen "Erie" (Eyrie) cr.,
which runs through the little mountain park called Garden of the Gods&mdash;a spot
not favorable to agriculture and one whose alleged proprietors maintain their
wonted alibi. Visitors who now inspect the natural curiosities hereabouts,
including a cave of very respectable dimensions and disagreeable atmosphere,
go up a carriage road which follows for some distance what was an old Indian
trail between South Park and the plains. Fountain r., thus composed, runs S.
along the E. base of the R. mts., receiving small affluents all along on either
hand, as Bear, N. Cheyenne, S. Cheyenne, Sand, Jimmy's Camp, and Little
Fountain creeks, and falls into the Arkansaw at Pueblo, as already said. It is
Pike's "North Fork" of the Arkansaw, and this is the stream nearly parallel
with which he proceeds via Turkey cr. toward the "high point of the blue
mountain," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, Pike's Peak. His breastwork was built on the S. side of the
Arkansaw, slightly above the confluence of Fountain r., and thus within present
city limits of Pueblo&mdash;though the built-up portions of South Pueblo are mostly
a mile or so from the confluence. A suburb of South Pueblo is called Bessemer,
where stand the great smelters and other evidences of that commercial
energy which has caused Pueblo to be sometimes styled "the Pittsburg of the
West," though the pure air is not to be compared with the smutty gas one
breathes at the old site of Fort Duquesne. A mile from Bessemer is Lake Minnequa,
a resort of the Pueblonians for boating, beer, and music. Pueblo has retained
for more than half a century a name that was originally not a proper but
a common noun. Thus we read in Frémont, Rep. 1845, p. 116: "Continuing
down the [Fountain] river, we encamped at noon on the 14th [of July, 1843]
at its mouth, on the Arkansas river. A short distance above our encampment,
on the left bank of the Arkansas, is a <i>pueblo</i>, (as the Mexicans call their civilized
Indian villages,) where a number of mountaineers, who had married Spanish
women in the vicinity of Taos, had collected together, and occupied themselves
in farming, carrying on at the same time a desultory Indian trade. They were
principally Americans, and treated us with all the rude hospitality their situation
admitted." Frémont calls the river "Fontaine-qui-bouit" (not <i>Bouille</i>). I
understand that Pueblo was known at one time, during the '40's, as Hardscrabble&mdash;a
name now given to another place, for which see a note beyond. I
am told by Mr. Maguire that "Jimmy's Camp"&mdash;now the name of a creek above
said&mdash;was a traditionally well-known place where one "Jimmy" had a small trading
outfit, mainly for the Utes; he was killed by the Plains Indians. Present
Jimmy Camp is a hamlet about Corral Bluffs, 9 m. due E. of Colorado Springs.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-45" id="Footnote_II-45" href="#FNanchor_II-45"><span class="label">[II-45]</span></a> This was a slight structure, occupied only for a few days, and soon disappeared.
But it is notable as the first wooden building of an American in present
Colorado, and very probably our flag first flew in that State over these logs.
There was no trace of it to be found in 1819, according to Long. It was built
on the S. side of the Arkansaw, a little above the then confluence of Fountain r.,
within the present city of Pueblo (South Pueblo). The precise spot has never
been recovered, and probably never will be. Changes in the river may have
soon washed it away, or left it at some unrecognizable point on the prairie.
The Arkansaw here has suffered great changes in details of its course, and is
liable to inundation: witness the disastrous flood this year (1894), which almost
drowned the city itself. In this connection I may cite part of an interesting
letter with which I am favored by Mr. C. H. Small of the Board of Trade of
Pueblo, whose knowledge of real estate in that city is probably unsurpassed.
It refers to the discovery by excavation of an old fort which cannot by any possibility
be Pike's, yet in the course of human nature is liable to become so considered
by some, and in due time to enter history as such. Mr. Small says:
"A fort was once built on the south side of the Arkansas just north of the
Farris Hotel&mdash;between this hotel and the Santa Fé R. R. tracks at Union
Avenue. The channel of the river changed in the seventies to a more southerly
and straighter course. The occupants of the fort were all massacred by Indians
on one occasion. In laying a pipe on Union Avenue two years ago [1892], one
or more skeletons were exhumed, doubtless the remains of those massacred.
This was at the depth of ten feet below the present level of the street, and
directly in front of the Farris Hotel; the logs of the old fort were come upon
at the same time. The grade of the street had been raised five feet, about
1885." Mr. Small's letter is dated Feb. 23d, 1894. In further correspondence
on this subject I am given to understand that this fort was an adobe structure
built by the American Fur Co., on what is now Union Avenue. On Christmas
Day, 1854, a drunken spree ended in a free fight, in which all the whites were
killed by the Indians but one, who fled to a smaller post on the Arkansaw at
the mouth of the St. Charles, 7 or 8 m. off, whence a burying-party came next
day. For a long time there was also an adobe tower or lookout on top of the
hill, about present intersection of Second and Summit streets; but it has
entirely disappeared.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-46" id="Footnote_II-46" href="#FNanchor_II-46"><span class="label">[II-46]</span></a> Pike starts up the W. bank of Fountain r., but soon bears N. W., directly
through the present city, in the direction of Turkey cr. This is a stream which
runs (when it runs anywhere) parallel with Fountain r., 10 to 15 m. further W.;
it heads about Cheyenne Peak, the foremost though not the highest of the Front
range in the vicinity of Pike's Peak. The air-line distance of Pike's Peak from
Pueblo is about 50 m.; the distance over any ground by which the summit
could be reached would be as far again. In making this side-trip our hero
proceeds with the determination expressed in the modern slang phrase, "Pike's
Peak or bust!" We must remember that he knew nothing of mountains, so to
speak, from personal experience, and had never in his life been higher than
some pass in the Alleghanies, perhaps about the elevation of the ground on
which he built his breastwork (say 4,700 feet). In the prairie close by
Colorado Springs there stands a little knob, up which a man could run in a few
minutes, and which has been dubbed in derision, "Mt. Washington," because
it is exactly as high as that celebrated peak in the White mts. of New Hampshire&mdash;6,288
feet. Though Pike never surmounted his eternal monument,
he overcame all those dangers, difficulties, and hardships which did "bust"
many a later, less hardy, and less resolute adventurer who "bucked against the
Rockies." Tourists and invalids have now the option of ascending to the
summit of his peak from Colorado Springs by stage, or from Manitou Springs
by the cogwheel railroad, which has been in operation since July, 1891. By
the latter mode of conveyance I have ascended the Rigi in Switzerland, as well
as Mt. Washington in my native State; but neither of these afforded the sensation
I experienced upon the summit of Pike's Peak, looking far down upon the
greatest elevation he attained on the present excursion. His 12 m. N. W.
to-day sets him on the prairie between Fountain r. and Turkey cr., nearer the
latter. The present road from Pueblo to Turkey cr. strikes the usually dry bed
of the latter at about 17 miles' distance, follows up the E. bank to the foot of
the mountain, crosses there, keeps on past East Turkey cr. through Dead Man's
cañon, crosses the heads of Little Fountain cr., and continues to skirt the E.
base of the range, past Cheyenne Peak to Colorado Springs. Up to the cañon,
at least, this is exactly the route Pike took to reach Mt. Cheyenne.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-47" id="Footnote_II-47" href="#FNanchor_II-47"><span class="label">[II-47]</span></a> In the hilly country along the E. side of Turkey cr., and then on that
creek, heading straight for Cheyenne Peak; camp on the creek when he came
to water, probably about where West Turkey cr. falls in; altitude perhaps
6,000 feet. The situation is now in the ravine of the creek, with elevations of
6,500 feet on the right, and others 7,000 to 8,000 feet on the left and ahead.
The creek receives small tributaries from the left all along, each gulch having
its little stream, or bed of one. One of the largest of these is West Turkey cr.,
running S. E. from altitudes of about 9,500 feet. Further along comes down
the parallel stream of East Turkey cr., heading S. from Mt. Rosa from altitudes
of about 10,500 feet, and falling in by Dead Man's cañon. The summit of
the Cheyenne mt. is due N. of Pike's present position, at an air-line distance
of 10 or 12 m.; Mt. Rosa bears N. by W., somewhat further off. The situation
is such that, if Pike should keep straight ahead, through Dead Man's
cañon, he would run across Little Fountain cr., and proceed to climb Cheyenne
mt. from the S.; but if he should bear to the left, up some one of the Turkey
Creek affluents I have mentioned or alluded to, he would much sooner reach
what he would be likely to call "the summit of the chain" (see <a href="#Page_458">text of the
27th</a>)&mdash;that is, an altitude of about 9,000 feet, with Mt. Rosa bearing N. and
the summit of Cheyenne mt. N. N. E., each at an air-line distance of 6 or
8 m. I think this was most probably his route; but do not see that we have
the data to establish the fact.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-48" id="Footnote_II-48" href="#FNanchor_II-48"><span class="label">[II-48]</span></a> Pike's expectation of climbing his peak and getting back to his camp on
Turkey cr. in one day may serve to console some who have thought they would
like to take a stroll before breakfast to the same peak from the Antlers Hotel in
Colorado Springs. Though Pike's actual footsteps in these mountains be not recoverable
with exactitude, there is no uncertainty as to <i>about</i> where he was on the
26th and 27th, when he climbed S. of Mts. Cheyenne and Rosa to an altitude
of about 9,000 feet, and then returned. Mt. Cheyenne is the foremost of the
group of peaks in this part of the Front range; it stands out in such bold relief
that uninformed visitors to Colorado Springs often mistake it for Pike's Peak.
But its altitude is only 9,407 or 9,948 feet, as estimated by different authorities,
and thus considerably less than that of various other peaks in the vicinity.
Some of these are: Cameron Cone, 10,685 or 11,560 feet; Mt. Rosa, 11,427
or 11,572 feet; Mt. Pisgah, given as 10,487 feet; Pilate Peak, given as 12,420
feet. The two last named are further W. and S.; Cheyenne, Cameron, and
Rosa form angles of a triangle, E. of Pike's Peak, that "grim sentinel of the
Rockies," as it is styled by some, or the "Grand Peak," as Pike calls it, which
towers over all the rest to the generally accepted altitude of 14,147 feet. These
figures can easily be recalled to mind if one remembers that twice seven is 14.
This peak is due W. of Colorado Springs, at an air-line distance of 12 m.
Visitors are driven to the summit by way of the Cascade carriage road, running
up Cascade cañon from a point in the Ute Pass 11 m. from Colorado Springs.
This stage route is a trifle over 17 m. from Cascade, or a total of about 28 m.
from the Antlers Hotel, Colorado Springs. During the season when the crop
of pink-toed tender-foots is harvested, wagons make the round trip in one day,
9 a. m.-6 p. m., spending an hour at the Halfway House and another at the
Peak. This is said to be the highest stage-line in the United States. There is
also a road up Bear Creek cañon to the Seven Lakes, but not to the Peak, and
no line of stages is regularly run on it. The Cheyenne Mountain road also
goes to these lakes, and has been run through to the mining camp on Cripple
cr., which lately made such a noise in Colorado. This is S. W. of the peak,
about 18 air-line miles from Colorado Springs. The Pike's Peak Cog Railway
takes a much shorter, steeper, and straighter course than the stage road, by way
of Ingleman cañon and Ruxton cr. The cog line starts from Manitou, 6¼ m.
from Colorado Springs, and is 8¾ m. long. The round trip is made in about
five hours, two hours each way, with one hour between, on the summit. This
is ample time; for tourists find Pike's Peak a convenient place to leave as soon
as they have paid twenty-five cents for a cup of the worst coffee in the world,
and tried in vain to stand up against a wind of 50 or 60 m. an hour. Those
who may be more interested in Pike's Peak at a distance are referred to a dainty
booklet entitled Legends of the Pike's Peak Region, 8vo, Denver, 1892; it is
full of quaint local lore, especially of the traditions of the only mountain Pike
climbed part way up. Among all the myths that cling to the Peak, obscuring
the facts in the case like the clouds that mantle the mountain, the very basic
one&mdash;that one on which the mountain rests, so to speak&mdash;is the universal
tradition that the brave young officer discovered and ascended the Peak which
upholds his name. One wishes that such laurels as he earned and well deserved
had been plucked from an eminence unknown and unattained before. But
Pike's Peak had been long and well known to the Spaniards; it was the Ultima
Thule of their possessions; and for that matter, was not Pike at the very time
in pursuit of the Spanish troops under Malgares, who had gone along just
before him? It is true that Pike, Robinson, Brown, and Miller&mdash;the four
whose names are thus linked should be upheld together&mdash;are the first white men
known to have come within "the distance of 15 or 16 miles" of the peak, as it
seemed to them, when the "Grand Peak" appeared "as high again as what we
ascended and would have taken a whole day's march to arrive at its base."
This is the testimony of the hero of the occasion; his evidence is alike incisive
and decisive. So far as we are informed by authentic history, Pike's Peak was
first surmounted by Dr. Edwin James, Mr. Wilson, and two other men, July
13th and 14th, 1820, during Major S. H. Long's expedition to the Rocky mts.,
when it was named James' Peak. When, where, and by whom the mountain
was first called Pike's Peak is unknown, to me at least; but its earliest appearance
in print should be discoverable. The date is probably somewhere in
the '40's, or still earlier. The name was certainly in verbal use in the '30's.
Mr. Oliver P. Wiggins, now of Denver, who was on the plains in 1838, heard
only "Pike's Peak," as a phrase already in common speech. Gregg's map of
1844 legends "Pikes Peak (or James')." Beckwith's Report of 1853, pub. 1855,
p. 30, has only "James'." The alternative names ran parallel for some years.
G. K. Warren states, Pac. R. R. Rep. XI., 1855, p. 24: "Captain Frémont, in his
report and map of explorations in 1843 and 1844, calls it Pike's Peak, probably
because it was so called by the white people in the country at the time":
see also George Frederick Ruxton's Adventures, etc., London, Murray, 1861,
but written much earlier. Governor Alva Adams, in the address already cited,
p. 13, discusses the point as "one of the historical mysteries," and adds: "The
name of Pike's Peak begins to appear in the literature of the prairies and mountains
about the middle of the century, but it was not irrevocably christened
until the Pike's Peak gold excitement, when the name was fixed to remain as
long as men love to listen to stories of valor." Whether it originated spontaneously
or was formally introduced, it will probably never die; the alliteration of
the words would be enough to keep the phrase in the mouths of the people, let
alone its justice and propriety. As for any Spanish claim which may hereafter
be established respecting prior discovery or ascent of the peak, the following
extract from the Legends already cited is pertinent: "From Pike's Peak to
Popocatepetl the land is a palimpsest, dotted with ruins of remotest antiquity,
the relics of a people whose records are replete with poetry and strange romance.
Their manuscripts enrich the archives of Mexico and Madrid, and yet we learn
but little of them. They moulder in the missions of the suspicious Spanish
priests, or among the mystic treasures of the Pueblos, and are decaying unread."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-49" id="Footnote_II-49" href="#FNanchor_II-49"><span class="label">[II-49]</span></a> The trail of this excursus, as dotted on Pike's map, would be enough to
show how far he was from reaching the summit of the "Highest Peak" there
delineated, in the absence of any other data. Such an affair as this would
never have been understated or underdrawn intentionally. Yet the dot-line
leaves him further from the peak than I am inclined to think he actually was;
but it is obviously incorrect in detail, and thus no offset to the explicit text.
The wide looping of the trail merely indicates a "round trip" from Pueblo and
return. The only considerable difference in Pike's going and coming was, that
in the latter case he "kept straight down the creek to avoid the hills," over
which he had before trudged. The map exaggerates the size of Turkey cr., as
well as of Fountain r. It is possible that someone thoroughly familiar with the
topography of the mountains at the heads of Turkey and Little Fountain creeks
may yet work out Pike's trail in exact detail.</p>

a crossing a little higher up. Passing up the N. bank, opp. Red cr., S., the
party continued to Carlisle Springs and camped in that vicinity, just over the
border of Frémont Co. Red cr. is lettered "Bed" on the G. L. O. map of
1892.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-2" id="Footnote_III-2" href="#FNanchor_III-2"><span class="label">[III-2]</span></a> The excessive estimate of the height of Pike's Peak, 18,581 instead of 14,147,
was in part due to a misapprehension of the elevation of the prairie whence
the observation was taken. This was assumed to be 8,000, but is really little,
if any, over 5,000. The altitude of Pico de Teyde, the volcanic Peak of
Teneriffe, in the Canary isls., is given on good authority as 12,200; and that of
Mt. Chimborazo, one of the highest peaks in the Ecuadorean Andes, is placed
at 20,498 feet by Whymper, who ascended it in 1880.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-3" id="Footnote_III-3" href="#FNanchor_III-3"><span class="label">[III-3]</span></a> Passing Beaver cr., N., with places called Beaver Depot and Beaver at and

its mouth, where one of the two railroads now makes a crossing; continuing up
N. bank, past Ute or Brush Hollow cr., N., and Eight Mile cr., N., to camp
below Six Mile cr., N., about opposite the mouth of Coal cr., S., where is now
the town of Florence.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-4" id="Footnote_III-4" href="#FNanchor_III-4"><span class="label">[III-4]</span></a> Passing opposite mouth of Oak cr., S., Six Mile cr., N., and Chandler cr.,
S., then coming to the "bad place of falling rocks," which is where a bluff
point comes down to the river&mdash;all these places within 2 or 3 m. of camp; and
continuing past Oil cr., N., to camp within the present limits of Cañon City,
Frémont Co. This is already a considerable village, and is growing. It nestles
directly at the foot of the mountains, under the shadow of Noonan's and Frémont's
Peaks, and derives its name from the remarkable formation which the
text presently describes. This is the Grand Cañon of the Arkansaw, a part
of which is well known to tourists as the "Royal Gorge," because it has been
exploited so much on the folders of the D. and R. G. R. R. But it is worthy
of exploitation, and does not disappoint the expectations raised by the advertisements
of the "scenic line of the world." Cañon City is almost in the very
jaws of this vast chasm, through which the Arkansaw has forced its way to
issuance on the plains. It was practically impassable, even afoot, until a way
was hewn and blasted for the railroad which now traverses its whole length.
Both trails which lead west from Cañon City get around the terrible place; one
on the north starts up Sand cr., past Noonan's and Frémont's Peaks, and swings
around to Parkdale at the head of the cañon; and the other, on the south,
crosses Grape cr., traverses Webster Park, and comes down Copper cr. to
Parkdale. Next after Pueblo, the basis of the Pike's Peak trip, as we have
seen, Cañon City is the most notable place on Pike's Arkansaw route. The
party stops here awhile to scout about, before starting for South Park; and to
this place they return afterward, build a blockhouse, leave two men, and start
on their perilous adventures by way of Grape cr. to the Sangre de Cristo range
and so to the Rio Grande.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-5" id="Footnote_III-5" href="#FNanchor_III-5"><span class="label">[III-5]</span></a> One of these is, of course, the main Arkansaw, in the Royal Gorge; the
other, on the left, or S., is Grape cr., which runs through the Wet mts. to
its confluence with the Arkansaw a mile or so above Cañon City, under
Noonan's Peak. Grape cr. used to be called Pike's fork of the Arkansaw, as by
Gregg, 1844; but this name lapsed. Bringing it in for a moment, we find the
"forks" of the Arkansaw to be: 1st fork of Pike, Purgatory r.; 2d fork of
Pike, Huerfano r.; 3d fork of Pike, St. Charles r.; Grand forks of Pike, confluence
of Fountain r. with the Arkansaw; Pike's fork of some books, Grape
cr. From his present position at Cañon City, Pike explores the Royal Gorge
and Grape cr. to some little extent, and abandons them both; he scouts about
for the Spanish trail, and having found it, as he supposes, starts N., up Oil
cr., very likely by the present road from the town to that stream.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-6" id="Footnote_III-6" href="#FNanchor_III-6"><span class="label">[III-6]</span></a> A mountain trail with no course or distance given is not encouraging to follow.
In earlier studies of Pike, I had supposed he reached South Park by way
of Currant cr., as he might have done. But no doubt remains in my mind that
he took the Oil Creek route. If we regard his map attentively, we see that he
went up along a large creek which he fetches into the Arkansaw <i>below</i> the blockhouse
he built on his return to Cañon City, and which is certainly Oil cr. Camp
of Dec. 10th is therefore in a "dry ravine" within "one mile" of Oil cr.&mdash;perhaps
at the first ravine above where Wilson cr. falls in from the left, or on
Wilson cr. itself. Oil cr. is a very well known stream, on the banks of which
oil works have been established, and at whose mouth is a place called Reno,
about 4 m. below Cañon City. It heads by two main branches and many small
tributaries in the mountains S. of Ute Pass, W. of Pike's Peak, and about Saddle
and Thirty-nine Mile mt., and runs S. about 50 m. into the Arkansaw.
Pike goes up Oil cr. and takes the western one of its two main branches, crosses
a divide, and strikes the South Platte r. in South Park.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-7" id="Footnote_III-7" href="#FNanchor_III-7"><span class="label">[III-7]</span></a> Pike has gone N. from Cañon City some 30 or 35 m., having Oil cr. on his
right, and having crossed certain of its tributaries from the west known as Wilson,
South Oil, and High creeks. He is now camped on West Oil cr. (the
western one of the two main branches), at or near a place called Truro. This is
a sufficiently well known locality, in a nest of mountains whence Oil cr. gathers
several affluents from various directions. On another branch of the creek is the
place called Alnwick, near where Riggs used to have his ranch, or in the same
place. West Oil cr. is also called Ten Mile cr.; another small stream is Martin's
or Slate cr. Some of the surrounding points are: Mt. Pisgah, 10,322 or
10,487 feet high; Rhyolite Peak, 10,860; Dome Rock or the Needle, 9,463
feet&mdash;these on Pike's right as he faces N., and S. W. to W. of his peak; while
on his left are in succession: Iron Knoll or Trachyte Knob (lettered "Trackite"
on G. L. O. map, 1892); Saddle mt.; Thirty-nine Mile mt., 11,000 feet;
Chalcedony Buttes, 10,400 and 10,200 feet. Now the usual way out of this
place is N. by Alnwick or Rigg's ranch, between Dome Rock and Saddle
mt., over a divide about 9,200 feet high, known as Two Creek or Twin Creek
Pass, which fetches out on S. Platte waters at Florissant, on the W. border
of El Paso Co.; but Pike takes a route to the left, up West Oil or Ten Mile cr.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-8" id="Footnote_III-8" href="#FNanchor_III-8"><span class="label">[III-8]</span></a> Between Arkansan and Missourian waters, in a broad sense; between the Oil
Creek branch of the Arkansaw and the South Platte r., in a stricter sense; more
exactly still, between West Oil or Ten Mile cr. and one of several small spring
runs that make into the S. Platte. Pike makes the pass between Ten Mile
mt. (right) and Thirty-nine Mile mt. (left), at an elevation of something over
9,000 feet. The difference between this Oil Creek way into South Park and
the way by Currant cr. is that, had he come up the latter, he would have
made Currant Creek Pass, 9,550 feet, between Thirty-Nine Mile mt. (right) and
Chalcedony Buttes (left); it is simply a matter of "cotoying" (flanking) Thirty-nine
Mile mt. E. or W. By the way he came, he strikes the South Platte r.,
in South Park, Park Co., at the very nearest approach it makes to the point
he left on the Arkansaw&mdash;that is to say, at the elbow it makes where, after
flowing S. E. through South Park, it turns sharp N. E. and enters what
is called the Upper or Eleven Mile cañon. These particulars are assured: for
Pike finds that the river "ran northeast." Camp of Dec. 13th is set in the
hills 2 m. south of the river, near the head of the cañon just said.</p>

<p class="footnote">Pike's route from Cañon City and back to that place has been a subject of
much doubt and discussion, in which some very wild notions have been indulged
by those who had any opinion whatever as to where he went on this
round trip. It has even been mooted whether he was ever on the South
Platte, or even in South Park at all. A cautious and tentative statement is ventured
in the 1889 Denver reprint of the London ed. of the Travels, where my
friend Mr. Maguire says in his new Preface: "The exact line of march of the
party from the time it reached the foot of the Grand Cañon ["Royal Gorge"]
of the Arkansas is not easy to trace. It is likely that it reached the Platte in
the South Park, and quite possible that it penetrated to the headwaters of the
Gunnison." I do not profess to be able to trail a mosquito over a granite
bowlder, but I think we shall be able to discover precisely where Pike went
on this trip, where he entered South Park, his course through it, the place
where he left it, and how, after ascending the Arkansaw for two days, he
descended this river to Cañon City. Every one of Pike's camps can be fixed
within 2 or 3 m., and some of them with absolute precision. He was never
on the Gunnison, or any other Pacific waters. One who wishes to satisfy himself
on all these points needs only to study Pike's text with Sheet vii. of Hayden's
Atlas of Colorado.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-9" id="Footnote_III-9" href="#FNanchor_III-9"><span class="label">[III-9]</span></a> At or near the place now called Howbert, on the N. bank of the S. Platte.
This great river has its uttermost source in that section of the Continental
Divide which bounds South Park on the N. W., above the sources of the Arkansaw,
and in the southward continuation of the same mountains. The latter,
bounding South Park on the W., and known as the Park range, are not the
Continental Divide, because the Arkansaw r. here intervenes, and the Divide
separates the Arkansan water-shed from that of Gunnison r. Having gathered
its numerous tributaries from these mountains, the South Platte sweeps
southeastward across South Park, and then turns abruptly northeastward to
leave the Park by the Eleven Mile Cañon already mentioned, finds its way
through the Front range south of Denver, and runs in the prairie till it joins
the North Platte in Lincoln Co., Nebraska. The Col. Mid. R. R. now
runs from Colorado Springs, past Florissant, through Eleven Mile cañon, and
skirts the South Platte across South Park, on its way to the already notable
mining camp Leadville, which no doubt has a future as well as a past; the
Denv., S. P., and Pac. R. R. traverses South Park from N. to S.; and each
of these roads leaves the park on the S. through Trout Creek Pass, where Pike
did also when he struck over for the Arkansaw. These points will appear more
clearly as we proceed to trail the Expedition through South Park.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-10" id="Footnote_III-10" href="#FNanchor_III-10"><span class="label">[III-10]</span></a> Further up the N. bank of the S. Platte, to vicinity of the C. M. R. R. station,
Sulphur Springs.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-11" id="Footnote_III-11" href="#FNanchor_III-11"><span class="label">[III-11]</span></a> Which could never be struck on any such course as this. To go hence S.
W. would take the Expedition over the Park range to the Arkansaw, thence over
the Continental Divide to the headwaters of the Gunnison, and so on.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-12" id="Footnote_III-12" href="#FNanchor_III-12"><span class="label">[III-12]</span></a> Hartsell's or Hartzell's ranch was located in the crotch of the forks Pike
passed, and the town or railroad station by this name is now 2 m. above, on the
N. bank of the S. fork, or Little Platte r. The two forks are of approximately
equal size; but the N. or right-hand fork is the main one. The other, left-hand
one, which Pike goes up a very short distance, and finds it does not suit
him, is formed by the confluence of various creeks, among which may be named
High, Herring's (Agate cr. of Hayden), Buffalo, and Long Gulch. Camp is
set about 2 m. west of Hartsell's, near where High cr. falls into this branch of
the S. Platte.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-13" id="Footnote_III-13" href="#FNanchor_III-13"><span class="label">[III-13]</span></a> Pike has actually got on the old San Juan road, which he follows more or
less nearly out of South Park, as does also a branch of the Col. Midl. R. R.
He enters those outliers of the Park range called the Trout Creek Pass hills,
gets over the range itself by this pass, supposed to be 9,800 feet high, and goes
down Trout cr. Some named places near or on his route are Salt Works, Mill
Top, Higgins', and McGee's. Camp on Trout cr., in the vicinity of the last
named place.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-14" id="Footnote_III-14" href="#FNanchor_III-14"><span class="label">[III-14]</span></a> Merely shifting camp a little distance down Trout cr. from the gorge to the
open country, about the mouth of the creek, through which the Arkansaw here
flows. It is a very well known place. The D. and R. G., the Col. Midl., and
the D., S. P., and P. R. R. come together here; in the immediate vicinity are
places called Charcoal (about where, I suppose, camp was set), Midway, and
Schwanders; a little below is Nathrop, where the D., S. P. and P. R. R. starts
over the Continental Divide for Gunnison; and a little above is Buena Vista, seat
of Chaffee Co., which Pike entered when he made the Trout Creek Pass. The
Arkansaw is here flowing about S. S. E. The Continental Divide is directly
W., 15 to 20 m.; the mountains that make it are the Sawatch range, some of
whose peaks along here are: Mt. Princeton, 14,190 feet, nearest Pike's camp;
Mt. Antero, 14,245; Mt. Shavano, 14,230; Mt. Keyes, 13,700. Arnold's cr.
falls in a little below Trout cr., on the same side; while from the Sawatch mts.
come Chalk and Cottonwood creeks, respectively below and above camp. Pike
is going to descend the Arkansaw from this station to Cañon City; but he first
starts his people in that direction, while with two men he makes a little reconnaissance
up river, in the narrow valley between the Sawatch and Park ranges.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-15" id="Footnote_III-15" href="#FNanchor_III-15"><span class="label">[III-15]</span></a> Pike stepped off the ties of the Col. Midl. R. R., if he went up the N. side
of the river, and those of the Denver and Rio Grande, if he passed on the other
side. His camp was between the station Fisher of the former railroad, and
Riverside of the latter, below the mouth of Pine cr., which comes down from
Mt. Harvard. To reach this point, he passed Buena Vista and the stations
Dornick and Americus; also, the place where one Leonard had his ranch, and
there used to be a toll-gate&mdash;for an old mail route passed by here. Two streams
he passed were Cottonwood cr., on the left, coming down from between Mts.
Princeton and Yale, latter 14,187 feet; and next Seven Mile or Sweetwater cr.,
on the right, down a branch of which came the old California road. He is
under the shadow of Mt. Harvard, of the Sawatch range, 14,375 feet high,
and Marmot Peak in the Park range.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-16" id="Footnote_III-16" href="#FNanchor_III-16"><span class="label">[III-16]</span></a> The highest point on the Arkansaw ever reached by the Expedition, and
that only by three of its members. This is the nearest Pike ever came to
Pacific waters; and it is close enough to have easily started the erroneous tradition.
This has been given currency in General A. W. Greely's sketch, and very
lately also supported by Governor Alva Adams, in his address, July 12th, 1894,
p. 13, where we read: "He wandered west over routes we cannot identify
until he must have found the Tomichi, a tributary of the Gunnison, and the
only time Pike touched Pacific waters." But let us see about this. Assuming
the substantial accuracy of Pike's mileages for the 21st and 22d, or at any rate,
that they were not <i>understated</i>, and taking the Trout Creek camp to have been
6 m. below Buena Vista, his uttermost point may be fixed within a mile or two
of Twin Lakes station on the D. and R. G. R. R. This place takes name
from the two beautiful lakes which lie from 2 to 5 m. westward. This determination
would be more particularly acceptable, as the point indicated falls
almost exactly on the boundary between Chaffee and Lake cos. I think, very
probably, that the "large point of the mountain," on turning which Pike viewed
the further course of the Arkansaw, was that sharp spur which projects to the
river on the left, 3 m. above Granite station and Cache cr., and at the foot of
which falls in the discharge stream from the lakes. Pike could have seen up
river a good way from any elevation in this vicinity, though by no means "at
least 35 miles." I doubt that the course of any river in these parts is continuously
visible for this distance; besides, there is no 35 m. of the Arkansaw above
Twin Lakes. The Arkansaw is composed from three branches which unite
west of Leadville&mdash;the middle, Tennessee fork, heading in the Continental
Divide, in and near Tennessee Pass, in relation with heads of Eagle r., a tributary
of the Grand; the east fork, heading about Frémont Pass with Ten Mile
cr., a tributary of Blue r. and so of the Grand; which two, having joined, are
joined by the west or Lake fork. There is little to choose between the middle
and east forks, as to which is the ultimate "source" of the Arkansaw. Both
are now meandered by the D. and R. G. R. R., the east one also by the Denver,
Leadville and Gunnison division of the U. P.; while the Col. Midl. goes along
the west fork. Below the junction of this fork the Arkansaw receives various
small tributaries, chiefly from the Park range on the east, as those from the
gulches known as Iowa, Thompson, Empire, Union, Weston, and Granite; the
corresponding streams on the other side, from the Sawatch range, mostly fall
into the west fork, as Half Moon cr. and others; but one which gathers from
Mt. Elbert falls into the main river 2 m. above the discharge of Twin Lakes.
The lesser of these two is fed by Lake and other small streams, and discharges
into the greater one, which in turn discharges into the Arkansaw. The lakes
are about 1½ and 2½ m. in their respective diameters. Between the two is a
place called Interlaken, reminding one of the fact that Colorado is often styled
the Switzerland of America.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-17" id="Footnote_III-17" href="#FNanchor_III-17"><span class="label">[III-17]</span></a> We must guess as well as we can where this was. Pike, Miller, and Mountjoy
started early from their camp below Pine cr., about Riverside station, and
made a forced march well into the night. We may credit them with 25 m., and
suppose them to be below Nathrop (which is on Chalk cr.), and somewhere in
the vicinity of Brown's cr., which falls in from the left.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-18" id="Footnote_III-18" href="#FNanchor_III-18"><span class="label">[III-18]</span></a> It is specially desirable to fix this Christmas camp, if not for the sentiment
of the thing, then because it is our initial point for the whole journey hence
down the Arkansaw to Cañon City. From anything that has preceded we do
not know where it was, within 10 m. But on the 26th Pike notes a "large
stream" from the south, at 7½ m. This is the South Arkansaw, which falls
in very near the well-known town of Salida. Salida is 7 m. by rail below a
station called Brown Cañon, which latter is a little above Squaw cr. Between
Salida and Brown Cañon the country is open and park-like among the mountains&mdash;just
the sort of a place where buffalo would herd in the winter. The
seasonable supply of eight beeves was got in consequence, and I have no doubt
that Christmas was spent in the immediate vicinity of Brown Cañon. The
mountain fastnesses about the headwaters of the Arkansaw long continued to
be wintering-grounds for the buffalo. Thus we find one of the most experienced
officers of our army making the following remark: "Although generally
regarded as migratory in their habits, yet the buffalo often winter in the
snows of a high northern latitude. Early in the spring of 1858 I found them in
the Rocky mountains, <i>at the head of the Arkansas and South Platte rivers</i>, and
there was every indication that this was a permanent abiding place for them,"
says Marcy, Pra. Trav. 1859, p. 234, half a century after Pike's fortunate find.
The herd now preserved in Yellowstone Park has no trouble with the deepest
snows and coldest weather of that region.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-19" id="Footnote_III-19" href="#FNanchor_III-19"><span class="label">[III-19]</span></a> Down the Arkansaw, past Squaw cr., right, and some runs in the park he
traversed, also past the stations Bellevue and Salida, to the mouth of the South
Arkansaw r., where the so-called Arkansaw hills on the north close in against
the Sangre de Cristo range on the south, thus straitening the valley. The S.
Arkansaw heads about Mts. Shavano and Keyes; its principal branch is
Poncho or Puncho cr. There was a good road up both these streams, which
are now meandered by railroads. Had Pike known it, he could have struck
up the S. Arkansaw to Poncho cr., and up this by Poncho Pass into Homan's
Park. This is <i>west</i> of the great Sangre de Cristo range, and is in fact the
upper part of the San Luis valley or basin of the Upper Rio Grande, which
Pike only reaches by a roundabout way, after subjecting himself and his
men to almost incredible sufferings. But it is easy to be wise after the event.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-20" id="Footnote_III-20" href="#FNanchor_III-20"><span class="label">[III-20]</span></a> To a point on the Arkansaw about the mouth of Badger cr., from the N.;
vicinity of station Wellsville or Badger.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-21" id="Footnote_III-21" href="#FNanchor_III-21"><span class="label">[III-21]</span></a> Camp in vicinity of that elbow which the river makes, nearly from S. E.
to E. N. E., and near where there is a way up a creek from the S. over the
S. de C. range by Hayden's Pass. The position is short of Bernard and even
of Oak Grove cr.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-22" id="Footnote_III-22" href="#FNanchor_III-22"><span class="label">[III-22]</span></a> Only to the vicinity of Bernard cr. (past Cotopaxi). Pike's mileages appear
excessive for the actual advance made, in comparison with modern schedules;
but he has to step over much ground for comparatively little progress. All his
distances to Jan. 5th require adjustment, or we should fetch him out a long
way below Cañon City.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-23" id="Footnote_III-23" href="#FNanchor_III-23"><span class="label">[III-23]</span></a> Camp about the mouth of Texas cr., a considerable stream from the
S., which falls in three or four miles below the mouth of Corral or Carroll
cr., another large one from the N.; Texas Creek station and a place called
Ford in the vicinity.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-24" id="Footnote_III-24" href="#FNanchor_III-24"><span class="label">[III-24]</span></a> Camp in the vicinity of the station Spikebuck. The river here bears
noticeably to the N. E. A little further along there is a sharp turn to the
S. E., at Parkdale. This place is at the head of the Grand Cañon proper, or
Royal Gorge, by rail 10 m. above Cañon City, 22 below Cotopaxi, and 46
below Salida; total, 56 m. from what is practically the same as Pike's camp
of Dec. 26th to that of Jan. 5th, when he reaches Cañon City. These figures
may be here compared with his mileages, which are: 12½ + 16 + 5 + 8 + 10¾ +
1 + 6 + 8 + 7 = 74¼. Details aside, the routes are identical; and a discrepancy
of 17 or 18 m. is not more than would be expected under the circumstances.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-25" id="Footnote_III-25" href="#FNanchor_III-25"><span class="label">[III-25]</span></a> For the past three days the party has been struggling with cumulative
difficulties that threaten to become insurmountable, and are already strung
along miles apart in the mountains. Yet Pike is only at the head of the Royal
Gorge&mdash;that Grand Cañon of the Arkansaw which he had before noted from its
lower end and regarded as impassable for horses. Parkdale is the place where
Currant cr. falls in on the N. or left. This is the large creek which heads in
the mountains about South Park, and which we have heard of before, when the
Oil Creek route to that park was in question: see back, <a href="#Footnote_III-6">note<sup>6</sup>, p. 464</a>. Now
we see more clearly than before that Pike never went up Currant cr. This has
two principal branches, both from the W., one called Cottonwood and the other
Tallahassee (Hayden), Tallahassa (Wheeler), or Talahsee (G. L. O., 1892,
brought into the Arkansaw as a separate tributary).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-26" id="Footnote_III-26" href="#FNanchor_III-26"><span class="label">[III-26]</span></a> It should be noted here that not one of the eight straggling parties managed
to get through the cañon itself. Some came over the mountains on the N.,
and the rest over those on the S. Pike alone essayed the gorge, but only got
halfway through. Next morning he escaped by scrambling up a small side cañon
which occurs on the N. side, and came down on the N. of Noonan's Peak.
This is the mountain that overhangs Cañon City, standing guard at the throat
of the gorge. Dr. Robinson and his man came that way too. Vasquez and his
men brought the horses the other way, across Webster Park, and had an easier
time of it. It was three days before all the party got in.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-27" id="Footnote_III-27" href="#FNanchor_III-27"><span class="label">[III-27]</span></a> Pike's map shows "Yellow Stone River Branch of the Missouri," with his
trail looped up to it. This of course is an egregious error, as the Yellowstone
is much further off, beyond anything that Pike sighted when he was highest on
the Arkansaw, Dec. 22d. Next N. of him there, and on the W. of the Continental
Divide, was Grand r., which unites with the Green to form the Colorado
of the West. This arises in Middle Park. North of this again, in North Park,
are the headwaters of the North Platte; and the southernmost heads of the
Yellowstone are still beyond these. The mountains which Pike legends "White
Snow" are the Sawatch range, continued southward by the Sangre de Cristo
range. All this part of Pike's map is too defective to be of any use in tracing
the trip just ended, and I have not had occasion to adduce it in support of the
text since we started up Oil cr. The dotted trail loops up the Arkansaw far
beyond the point Pike reached, and a number of the camps he made are
omitted. The best delineation of Pike's route in South Park and about the
headwaters of the Arkansaw is that traced on Josiah Gregg's map of the Indian
Territory, etc., in his Commerce of the Prairie, 1844. This loops Pike around
the Park, thence almost to the source of the Arkansaw, and back down this
river&mdash;which is quite right. This case must be more accentuated, because tradition
<i>will</i> have it that Pike got over on Pacific waters&mdash;not a drop of which he
ever saw.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-28" id="Footnote_III-28" href="#FNanchor_III-28"><span class="label">[III-28]</span></a> Marked "&#9633; Block house" on Pike's map. Lewis and Clark's map of 1814
letters "&#9633; Block House U. S. Factory in 1806" on the same spot on the "Rio
de Nanesi," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the Arkansaw. The building stood on the N. bank of the
Arkansaw, doubtless within present limits of Cañon City. All trace of the
structure seems to be gone, and I doubt that the precise spot will ever be recovered.
My correspondence with several persons in Cañon City and vicinity
has availed nothing. But the location at Cañon City is unquestionable.</p>

<p class="footnote">The terrible trip Pike now ventures to make should not have been attempted
in the dead of winter, with his miserable outfit. Pike was brave to excess, as
we know; that and the mysterious <i>crux</i> of the orders he had from Wilkinson
about the Spanish business must excuse this particular piece of foolhardihood.
A more experienced mountaineer, with any concern for his own life, to say
nothing of the lives of his men, would not have bucked up against those mountains
under such circumstances. If he had had to hunt for the unknown sources
of a river which came eastward from there, he would have backed out of the
mountains, gone down the Arkansaw a piece, struck south at his convenience till
he found his river, and then considered the chances of being able to follow it
up to its source. That Red r. of which Pike is supposed to have gone in search
was never found, for the simple reason that there is no such river in that part of
the world&mdash;as probably Pike himself knew. He had a chip on each shoulder
for some Spaniard to please knock off; his coat-tails were dragging all over
the R. mts. for some Spaniard to please step on; and he would rather have
broken some Spanish heads than have discovered the head of any river.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-29" id="Footnote_III-29" href="#FNanchor_III-29"><span class="label">[III-29]</span></a> This "18" is a misprint for 12. There were but 16 persons all told, of
whom 2 are left when Pike, Robinson, and 12 soldiers proceed to tempt fate.
The 12 were: Sergeant Meek, Corporal Jackson, Privates Brown, Carter,
Dougherty, Gorden, Menaugh, Miller, Mountjoy, Roy, Sparks, Stoute.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-30" id="Footnote_III-30" href="#FNanchor_III-30"><span class="label">[III-30]</span></a> The "South fork" of the Arkansaw, afterward sometimes called Pike's
fork, as for example on Gregg's map, 1844, and which he now proceeds to ascend,
is Grape cr. This considerable stream arises on the eastern slopes of the
Sangre de Cristo range, waters the Wet Mountain valley, receives various
tributaries from the western slope of the Wet mts., and traverses a gorge in
the latter to fall into the Arkansaw from the S. W., about a mile above Cañon
City. The general course is about N. from its uttermost head in the S. de C.
range, in the vicinity of Music Pass. Here its watershed is separated, on
the E. side of the range, by a divide, on the other side of which are certain
sources of the Huerfano r.; while on the west of the S. de C. range the connection
is with "Meadow" (qu. Medano?) cr., a tributary of San Luis cr., in the
valley of the latter name, and consequently in the basin of the Rio Grande&mdash;that
"Red river" which Pike seeks in vain. To-day he strikes Grape cr.
at or near present site of Williamsburg, a station on the railroad which once
meandered Grape cr. to Silver Cliff, but was washed out and abandoned. This
is a good way below the entrance of Pine cr., a branch which falls into Grape cr.
from the W. This may seem short for the "13" m. of the text; but if anyone
should think so, he has only to start from Cañon City to change his mind by the
time he finds himself on Grape cr. by the present best trail. Besides, we shall
soon see that we have to shorten up all of Pike's mileages in this rough country.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-31" id="Footnote_III-31" href="#FNanchor_III-31"><span class="label">[III-31]</span></a> Past Pine cr., to some point on Grape cr. short of the boundary between
Frémont and Custer cos., probably in the vicinity of Soda Springs or the station
Grape. Pike is flanking a mountain as well as meandering a crooked creek;
and, aside from any question of typographical error, we have to adjust his whole
set of ostensible mileages by the topography of the country. If we should
apply the figures he gives to the flat face of the map, we should run him clear
over into New Mexico before he reaches his camp on the Conejos in Colorado.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-32" id="Footnote_III-32" href="#FNanchor_III-32"><span class="label">[III-32]</span></a> Over the line from Frémont into Custer Co., past Grape and Blackburn, to
camp about the mouth of Silver cr. This heads about Mt. Tyndall and Mt.
Herring, and by another branch N. of these; it runs N. W. and then N. to
fall into Grape cr., between Blackburn and Gove. Camp is 6 or 8 m. (air-line)
due N. of Round mt. and town of Silver Cliff; but much further by the meanders
of the creek or either of the roads through the mountains.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-33" id="Footnote_III-33" href="#FNanchor_III-33"><span class="label">[III-33]</span></a> "White" and "Snow" are Pike's names for what he regarded as a continuous
chain from as far N. as he knew anything about it, to the Sierra Blanca
of New Mexico. That is to say, the names cover the whole Sawatch range,
along the Continental Divide, and the Sangre de Cristo range; which latter
separates the Arkansaw from the Rio Grande basin, and ends on the S. with
the bold elevations of the Sierra Blanca, or White mts. of modern geography.
In saying that the "great White mountain presented itself," Pike means that
he has reached a point in the Wet Mountain valley where he has the Sangre
de Cristo range immediately before him, on the W. In this direction are the
heads of the Texas cr., already mentioned (p. 475), and of Swift or Dutch cr.,
draining eastern slopes of the mountains, two of the nearest points of which are
Electric Peak and Monte Rito Alto, the latter 12,863 or 12,989 feet high, according
to whether Lieut. Wheeler or Dr. Hayden made the most accurate
determination.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-34" id="Footnote_III-34" href="#FNanchor_III-34"><span class="label">[III-34]</span></a> This is the most difficult itinerary of the whole trip, and much depends upon
its correct recovery. It is out of the question to take "28 miles" at its face value;
the difficulty must be adjusted. Pike's trail shows with substantial accuracy
his three camps of the 14th, 15th, and 16th, along Grape cr.; then a long loop
S. E. and back S. W. to a point on Grape cr. again, above two creeks coming
down from the Sangre range. I think these creeks can be identified; this
would fix to-day's camp with sufficient precision. I base my conclusions on
Pike's whole set of mileages for this trip, as applied to the topography of the
route. Thus we have, going up Grape cr., 13 + 19 + 18 = 50 m.; with 4 more
miles on the 17th, making 54 to the point where this creek is left. Further on
come (28 - 4 =) 24 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 14 = 63 m., which puts Pike
over the Sand Hill Pass on the 27th. Finally, we have 15 + 17 + 24 + 18 = 74
m., in the San Luis valley to the stockade on the Rio Conejos; total, 191 m.
The three sections of this route&mdash;the Grape Creek course, the Wet Mountain
Valley course, the San Luis Valley course&mdash;are practically, therefore, in the ratio
of 5 : 6 : 7; and such figures must be made to fit the known geography of the
route. I make the journey of the 17th as follows: Pike proceeds up Grape
cr. a short distance, leaves it, flanks Round mt., and passes by or near the
present site of Silver Cliff, seat of Custer Co.; continues S. E. across the valley
or prairie to the base of the Wet mts., in the vicinity, not immediate, of Mt.
Robinson, Mt. Brinley, and Rosita, where the mines of the latter name were or
are; where, not liking the place, as there was no fuel, he turns about S. W. and
repasses the valley at a right angle to his other course through it, recrosses Grape
cr. a little below the confluence of Rosita cr., and camps under the Sangre de
Cristo range, somewhere about Spring cr. or Horse cr. This day was disastrous,
as a culmination of misery already endured by the handful of half-naked and
more than half-starved adventurers, for whom still more acute suffering was in
store. The wonder is not at any error in distances, but that any intelligible
itinerary of such a journey has reached us from the splendidly brave young
fellow, who so rashly led his companions into a death-trap. But for the buffalo
which were wintering in the Wet Mountain valley, not a man would have
escaped with his life. Whatever the exact spot, this is the place where poor
Sparks and Dougherty were abandoned with frozen feet. What they endured
may be imagined from the mute messages Pike afterward received from them&mdash;a
present of some of the bones which came away from their gangrenous feet
after sphacelus had set in.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-35" id="Footnote_III-35" href="#FNanchor_III-35"><span class="label">[III-35]</span></a> By Pike's map, this should be the next to the last creek before Grape cr. is
headed&mdash;the first one above Horse cr. If so, the party are in the vicinity of
the place now called Blumenau.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-36" id="Footnote_III-36" href="#FNanchor_III-36"><span class="label">[III-36]</span></a> About to the ultimate forks of Grape cr. The S. end of the Wet Mountain
valley is a sort of pocket where the Wet mts. connect with the Sangre range
by intermediate elevations (as Promontory Bluffs, etc.). Creeks come into
the valley from the E., S., and W., converging to compose Grape cr., the ultimate
tributary of which is now known as Cottonwood cr. The border of this
pocket, on the S., is the boundary between Custer and Huerfano cos.&mdash;an
irregular line continuing on the W. along the main ridge of the Sangre range,
and on the E. along that ridge of the Wet mts. which divides sources of
Hardscrabble cr. and St. Charles and Greenhorn rivers from those of the
Huerfano.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-37" id="Footnote_III-37" href="#FNanchor_III-37"><span class="label">[III-37]</span></a> Taking the party over the low divide mentioned in the last note, from
Custer into Huerfano Co., and from the Grape Creek watershed to that of the
Huerfano. The exact spot is perhaps not determinable, but it was not far from
Bradford, a place on Muddy cr., one of the first two forks of the Huerfano.
The map shows that Pike has headed Grape cr. and got into another basin,
from which he starts a river running out on the prairie to the Arkansaw. This
is by mistake made out to be his "3d Fork," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the St. Charles and Greenhorn;
it is really his "2d Fork," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the Huerfano.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-38" id="Footnote_III-38" href="#FNanchor_III-38"><span class="label">[III-38]</span></a> If we call the roll to-day we find: Vasquez and Smith left at Cañon City
on the 14th; Sparks and Dougherty left at camp of the 22d; Menaugh left at
camp of the 26th; present on the 27th, Pike, Robinson, Meek, Jackson,
Brown, Carter, Gorden, Miller, Mountjoy, Roy, Stoute = 11.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-39" id="Footnote_III-39" href="#FNanchor_III-39"><span class="label">[III-39]</span></a> The Expedition crosses the Sangre de Cristo range to the basin of the Rio
Grande, and is about to enter the San Luis valley. The matter of the pass by
which they came has been much mooted and left in doubt. Thus we find
Maguire saying in the preface to the Denver ed. of Pike, p. xi: "Whether
this pass was the Mosca or the Medano (known also as 'Sandhill') or whether
it was one still farther to the north as thought by some, cannot be definitely
established." Governor Adams in his Address, p. 17, says "Medano or
Music Pass." I think it is certain that the Expedition made the Sand Hill
Pass, and I hope to be able to settle the question. The three passes to which
Maguire refers, and the only ones to be considered for a moment, are the following,
in order from N. to S.</p>

<p class="footnote">1. A pass from Antelope cr., one of the heads of Grape cr., in Custer Co.,
over to a tributary of San Luis r. in Saguache Co., not traversing any portion
of Huerfano Co., or barely touching the extreme N. W. corner of this county&mdash;in
fact, Custer, Huerfano, and Saguache cos. meet in this pass, and Muddy as
well as Antelope cr. heads there. This is the "one still farther to the north"
to which Maguire alludes. It is the one marked "Music Pass" on the G. L. O.
and U. S. G. S. maps of 1892 (but not the Music Pass of Hayden's map).
This seems to me so far N. as to be out of the question, if any reliance is to be
placed on either Pike's mileages or his map. Even after the utmost reduction
of his distances that can be made with any regard to the topography of the
region, we fetch him out of the Grape Creek basin, into that of the Huerfano,
and thus well along in Huerfano Co. His map bears this out completely.
Observe that on the 24th he has <i>crossed</i> the head of Grape cr., left it a good
way behind him, and marked his camp near the head of the other stream&mdash;the
Huerfano. Notice also that from this camp of the 24th-26th the trail makes
a sharp elbow <i>west</i>, and goes through the Sangre range in a gap next <i>below</i> that
one in which he makes Grape cr. head. Again, if he had made this northernmost
pass he would have come out N. of the Sand Dunes, and had these on his
left as he went S. in the San Luis valley; whereas, we find them on his right as
he comes down from the mountains to the S. of them. Finally, the mileages of
the San Luis Valley route do not fit so well from this pass as from the next one.
These facts seem to me to prove that Pike made no pass N. of the sand-hills.</p>

<p class="footnote">2. The Sand Hill Pass, also rightly Medano and wrongly Modenos Pass, called
Music Pass by Hayden, and Williams' Pass by Gunnison and Beckwith, is that
which connects Navajo or Greaser cr. (br. of Muddy cr.) with a certain tributary
(Medano or Sand cr.) of the San Luis r. This is on the boundary between
Huerfano and Saguache cos., about 5 m. (air-line) S. of Music Pass. The
Huerfano gathers its waters in the valley called Huerfano Park. The three
principal tributaries, from the N. to N. W., are Turkey, Wilson's, and Muddy
creeks. The place Bradford, already named as that to the vicinity of which
we traced the Expedition, without reference to any question of a pass, is on
Muddy cr., and a road goes direct from this place through this pass. That
branch of Muddy cr. by some called Navajo cr. drains from this pass, and
Greaser cr. also heads in its immediate vicinity. Across the divide, which sinks
to an altitude of about 9,800 feet at the pass, Medano or Sand cr. drains S. W.
and then S. between the Sand Dunes and the mountains, in the San Luis basin
(Saguache Co.). That Pike took this route I have no question. There seems
also to have been no doubt in the minds of Captain Gunnison and Lieutenant
Beckwith, who quote Pike on their approach to this pass, Aug. 25th, 1853, and
add: "The course of Williams' Pass as we entered it [from the sand-hills] is
N. 58° E., but it soon bends to the left to N. 27° E. We passed up it only
about three-fourths of a mile. Its width is about 250 yards, rising gradually as
far as we could see. Its walls of rock rise on either side to a height of some
hundreds of feet, and are nearly vertical. Our guides represent it as continuing
for 14 miles, both in character and direction as here described; beyond that it
is more abrupt, terminating at its summit less favorably for a road than
Roubideau's Pass. It is followed by a large Indian trail." (P. R. R. Rep. II.,
1855, p. 43.)</p>

<p class="footnote">3. Mosca or Musca Pass, also called Fly Pass by some, translating the
Spanish, and by others Robideau's Pass, 6 or 8 m. in an air-line S. of the Sand
Hill Pass, is a lower and better one. It connects the Bear Creek branch of
May cr. (the latter a tributary to the Huerfano) with the branch of Mosca cr.
on the other side of the divide. There is a place called Sharpsdale on Bear or
May cr., whence a road goes W. up to the pass, and others N. to Bradford,
E. through Poison cañon to Gardner on the Huerfano at the mouth of Muddy
cr., and also E. down May cr. and along the Huerfano to Point of Rocks and
Malachite, and so on to Gardner. On the subject of Mosca Pass Maguire's
remarks seem to me judicious, and I transcribe them to express my concurrence
in his decision: "In the early days of the settlement of the country the Mosca
was well travelled by the Southern Utes on their journeys to the Plains, and their
'hieroglyphics,' of which Pike speaks, were to be seen cut in the bark of the
aspen trees; but from the fact that on reaching San Luis valley on January
28th, 1807, the party marched some considerable distance on a course lying
between the sand dunes and the mountains, the evidence would seem to warrant
the belief that the pass used was north of the Mosca."</p>

<p class="footnote">There are other passes of this range, as the one called Sangre de Cristo, and
the Veta Pass (which latter is now utilized by the D. and R. G. R. R.). But
these are altogether too far S., and have never been brought in question. There
seems to be no named or used pass from the head of the Huerfano itself. The
ultimate heads of this river drain N. from Cerro Blanco and Baldy Peak, with
collateral sources thence along the line between Huerfano and Costello cos.
to Grayback and Iron mts., etc., besides those from the W. on the line
between Huerfano and Saguache cos. in the direction of Mosca Pass.</p>

<p class="footnote">In view of the above considerations, we will proceed with Pike through Medano
or Sand Hill Pass into San Luis valley (or Park). This is a plain between
the Sangre de Cristo range on the E. and N. E., and on the W. and N. W.
the San Juan and Sawatch ranges. It has a total length of about 110 m. from
Poncho Pass on the N. to Taos valley on the S., with a maximum breadth of
about 45 m., and an area of upward of 3,000 square miles. The general elevation
is between 7,500 and 8,000 feet. The Rio Grande enters this valley at about
the middle of its W. side, running E. and then sweeping in a long curve S.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-40" id="Footnote_III-40" href="#FNanchor_III-40"><span class="label">[III-40]</span></a> The billows of sand which Pike has on his right as he comes down Sand cr.
from Sand Hill (Music, Medano) Pass are very remarkable formations, which
alone would fix his position in the lack of any other data. West of these Dunes
are several streams of the San Luis system, flowing southward to form sinks
called the San Luis lakes, though Pike's map runs them into the Rio Grande.
His camp is on or near Sand cr., at about the point where this and Mosca cr.
join, or perhaps a little further along. Mosca cr. is the one that comes down
from Mosca Pass, and if Pike had made this pass he would have fetched out in
the valley at about the same spot&mdash;at or near Montville.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-41" id="Footnote_III-41" href="#FNanchor_III-41"><span class="label">[III-41]</span></a> About S., along the W. base of the Sierra Blanca, which is simply the continuation
of the Sangre de Cristo range. Some of the summits Pike has on his
left are: Grayback Peak, 12,387 feet; Bald, Baldy, or Old Baldy mt., 14,125
feet; and Cerro Blanco itself, 14,431 feet, giving name to the group. Pike
goes from the vicinity of Montville past Zapato cr., probably on the present
road through the town of the latter name on the creek, and camps in the
valley at the place where timber reaches furthest from the mountains. A
present road curves S. E. from this point, around to the S. of the range, where
was built Fort Garland, probably 12 or 15 m. S. E. of to-night's camp. This
was a sort of focal point to which roads converged from various points, and
especially was it on the most direct route from any place in the lower part of the
San Luis valley through Sangre de Cristo Pass to the Huerfano, and so on.
Garland was on Ute cr., a branch of Trinchera cr., which latter falls into the
Rio Grande about 3 m. above the Rio Conejos.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-42" id="Footnote_III-42" href="#FNanchor_III-42"><span class="label">[III-42]</span></a> Pike reaches the Rio Grande on a S. W. course, about the present position
of the town of Alamosa, whence railroads now radiate in or converge from four
directions. These branches of the Denver and Rio Grande system come from
the E. through the Veta Pass, from the N. directly down the San Luis valley,
from the N. W. down the Rio Grande, and from the S. up the same
river. A few miles S. of Alamosa, Alamosa and La Jara creeks fall in close
together, from the W. These are both indicated by a single unlettered trace
on Pike's map. Next below Trinchera cr. falls in on the E. This is the one
called Rio de la Culebra on Pike's map, which correctly brings it in above the
one from the W. (Rio Conejos) on which he established himself. The Rio
Culebra is the next one, from the E., below Trinchera and Conejos, and above
Rio Costilla. Pike lays down the Costilla by its proper name, omits the
Culebra, and calls the Trinchera by the name of the latter. In English, Rio
Conejos would be Rabbit r.; Culebra, Snake r.; Costilla, Rib r.; and Trinchera,
Cut-bank r. Alamosa should imply that the river so called were shaded
with elms, though cottonwood (<i>Populus angustifolia</i>) is the actual growth. La
Jara is properly the rock-rose (<i>Cistus creticus</i>), but as a name of this creek it
refers to willow-brush.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-43" id="Footnote_III-43" href="#FNanchor_III-43"><span class="label">[III-43]</span></a> Of which about 13 (misprinted "18") was down the Rio Grande, the rest
up the Rio Conejos; Trinchera cr. (the one from the E., which Pike's map
letters "Rio de la Culebra") was passed a short distance above the Conejos.
The latter is a large stream from the W. which arises in the San Juan range,
in the vicinity of Conejos Peak (13,183 feet), leaves the mountains by the foot
of Prospect Peak (6,837 feet), is joined in the San Luis hills by San Antonio cr.
(its principal branch), and then seeks the Rio Grande by winding about the
northern ends of the hills just named. The data already given, with those
details which the text presently offers, serve to fix the present station with precision&mdash;about
5 m. up the Conejos, on its N. bank, at a point where it was not
fordable, and directly S. of which was a high hill. A sufficiently large map,
such as Sheet X of the Hayden survey, shows exactly these topographical
details, and also marks two ranches in the immediate vicinity: see also Pike's
own map. Under these circumstances it seems to me wasted ingenuity to find
Pike's blockhouse in some other place; yet its locality has been disputed.
Maguire puts the case well: "The exact locality of the site (a notable spot in
Western history) is in dispute, owing to the discovery many years ago of the
remains of an ancient log structure further W. on the Conejos, which some
suppose to have been Pike's fortress; but everything in the narrative, as well
as in the Spanish records, indicates the prairie opposite the mineral springs and
high hill on the S. bank of the Conejos as the spot where the flag of the United
States is first recorded as floating above the soil of Colorado." Gregg's map
locates the place approximately, with the legend "&#9633; Pike's Stockade Whence
taken to Santa Fé. Feb. 1807".</p>

<p class="footnote">Concerning the exact location of Pike's post on the Conejos, I am favored
with the following letter (cited in substance) from Mr. Maguire, an old resident
of the San Luis valley:</p>

<p class="footnotel25">
"<span class="smcap">Denver, Colo.</span>, <i>April 18th, 1894</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote">"<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p class="footnote">"... As to the disputed stockade on the Conejos: I am entirely familiar
with that country, and had fixed it as having been situated in the prairie on the
N. bank of the stream due across from what is known as the Ojo Caliente.
Before writing the preface to the Denver reprint of Pike, I had made up my
mind to that, although it was contended in the neighborhood that the stockade
had been situated some 14 or 15 m. from the mouth of the stream. This supposition
was due to the fact that Lafayette Head, the oldest American settler on
the Conejos, who came there early in the fifties, was lieutenant-governor of this
state, and a man of high standing and much authority, had asserted that the fort
had been built much further up the stream than the site I had accepted. In
1890 I saw Mr. Head upon the subject, and he told me that when he first came
to the country there still existed on the Conejos the remains of a structure of
cottonwood logs laid horizontally, which he had seen, and which was so old that
the logs would scarcely bear the weight of one's foot. Upon this evidence, with
or without suggestion from some source, he concluded it was Pike's fort, and so
gave out; whence the prevalent impression. That Mr. Head saw this structure
there is no question. I have no idea what it was, or when or by whom built;
but it would be useless to pursue this matter, because Mr. Head is positive that
the location was on the <i>south</i> side, and therefore the structure cannot have been
Pike's. The Ojo Caliente above mentioned is on the property of Mr. A. W.
McIntire, as is also the prairie opposite, on the north bank of the river. Mr.
McIntire is a Pike enthusiast, very much interested in the case. When in
Denver recently he startled me by stating that we had been in error as to the
exact location, as he had become convinced it was about half a mile below the
Ojo Caliente. This half-mile bears a remarkable relation to the statement in
your letter to me: 'I have it probably within half a mile.' Mr. McIntire says
that the depression caused by digging the moat is still visible. The place is on
the north bank of the Conejos, opposite some warm or mineral springs flowing
out of the hill on the south side; and Mr. McIntire informs me that the spot is
a little north of the center of Sect. 7, T. 35, R. 11.</p>

<p class="footnotel45">
"Very truly yours,<br />
"<span class="smcap i2">W. M. Maguire</span>."</p>

<p class="footnote">Later correspondence on this subject with Mr. Maguire includes a letter and
sketches from Gov. McIntire, who is satisfied that he has the exact site. He
marks it on a township map which he transmits, as on the middle of the W.
line of the N. W. ¼ of the N. E. ¼ of Sect. 7, T. 35, R. 11, just across the
Conejos, under a hill from out of which flows a mineral or thermal spring which
never freezes, at a point so chosen that the current in the river would not cut the
ditch around the work. Gov. McIntire's sketch represents the ditch as 2½&mdash;3
feet deep, 68 steps long (including an unbroken place of 13 steps), and of semi-circular
figure; the two ends of this figure against the river, in a small deep
bend, so that the river and the ditch inclose an oval space 37 steps in the
longest diameter. This seems large for such a temporary work as Pike started,
but he tells us that it was never finished, and Gov. McIntire is persuaded that
the ditch is not a natural formation. I am therefore led to believe that he has
found the right spot.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-44" id="Footnote_III-44" href="#FNanchor_III-44"><span class="label">[III-44]</span></a> That our friend Robinson was, in plain English, a spy, is incontestible. If
he had any other object in joining the Expedition, it is certain that he had no
other in leaving it than to find out what he could about New Spain for the
benefit of his own country. Had it been in actual war times he could have been
hanged or shot by the Spaniards without violation of the customs of nations.
As it was, Pike felt so apprehensive for Robinson's personal safety that when
the two met in New Mexico Pike at first affected not to know Robinson, for
fear of putting him in jeopardy, and he denied point-blank to the Spanish
authorities that Robinson was one of the party. They had parted on the
Conejos with a perfect understanding on such points; indeed, General Whiting
calls it "in pursuance of a previous scheme" that Robinson set out alone for
Santa Fé; meanwhile, Pike sat down on the Conejos to wait for the Spaniards
to come and catch him. The ostensible object of Robinson's visit to Mexico
was fictitious; Pike says himself that the commercial claim Robinson pretended
to have was worthless "in his hands." Whiting observes that "it was
transferred to Dr. Robinson, who was to make it a pretext for a visit to the
place, and a cover for observing its trade and resources, for the benefit of his
countrymen. He regarded the excursion as a romantic adventure, and in that
mood detached himself from the protection of his friend and commanding
officer." (Life of Pike, p. 272.)</p>

<p class="footnote">The <i>ultima ratio</i> of Pike's presence on the Rio Grande in Spanish territory
will probably always remain in question, unless some documentary evidence, not
yet forthcoming, should turn up to show whether he came there by accident or
design. Perhaps the safest ground to take would be to suppose it the particular
accident of a general design. His open and official instructions required him
to "approximate" to the Spanish possessions; he was to spy out all the land
and see how it lay, politically as well as geographically; hunt up the Comanches;
and make a counter-demonstration to Malgares' spirited raid, involving a
reconnoissance in force as a military operation. This may all be true of the
general design of his expedition, but it may as easily be true that he lost his way
in searching for the Red river, and only found his way to the Rio Grande by
accident. This seems to be the view of his biographer, General Whiting, who
was a very competent critic of Pike's military career, and who wrote in comparatively
short historical perspective, though he does not seem to have possessed,
or at any rate to have utilized, any private sources of information.
Whiting fully acquits Pike of intentional errancy, and gives no hint that he is
keeping anything back that would support any other view of the case than that
which he presents, without apparent reserve or arrière-pensée. Some of his
expressions may be here cited. Speaking of Pike's seeing a Mexican newspaper
with an account of Burr's conspiracy, he remarks, p. 277: "This afforded a
clew to the suspicions with which his movements on the Mexican frontier had
most naturally been regarded. It was not surprising that he should have been
looked upon as forming one of the ramifications of the revolutionary scheme
which that distinguished individual had projected.... It was true, that he had
been found, with a belligerent aspect, in the Mexican country; but his apology
was ready, and, no doubt, acceptable; while he knew that the Mexican authorities
had lately violated, in a similar way, the soil of the United States, for which
no apology could be rendered.... His misapprehensions of the geography of
the country, which led him to establish himself in such a suspicious manner,
on a foreign river, were excusable, bewildered as he was among mountains
and streams that were likely to confuse all calculations. Still, it was
natural for the Mexican authorities to regard his conduct, at first, as the result
of a design, rather than a mistake, particularly when taken in connection with
Colonel Burr's contemporaneous movements; and their treatment of him must
be considered under the circumstances, as having been marked by much consideration."
General Wilkinson also alludes to the assertion that had been
made, that the expedition which resulted in the orders he had given Pike "was
a premeditated coöperation with Burr." The Mexicans, it seems, were not alone
in their suspicions and expressions to that effect.</p>

<p class="footnote">However the bottom facts of Pike's coming on the Rio Grande may turn out
to be, it is certain that after he had been captured and taken to Mexico under
the diplomatic disguise of a polite invitation to visit the governor, who had
heard of his having lost his way, hastened to send to his rescue, etc., Pike
turned spy and informer with great agility and signal success. He kept his
temper well in hand, except on one or two occasions; and in several instances
showed that art which diplomacy has been defined to be. He bore himself with
courage, dignity, and much fertility of resources; while that duplicity and prevarication
which he confesses his conscience condoned, if it did not justify, were
never indulged from personal considerations, but from his intense patriotism.
His love of his country was the crucible in which he assayed his own motives;
that was fervid enough to relax the rigidity of morals he professed and
practiced on all ordinary occasions, and induce a certain ethical elasticity, so
to speak, if not actually to melt all scruples. Patriotism must sometimes
shake hands with Jesuitism in this wicked world; and the majesty of the flag,
like the glory of God, must be maintained by human means. Abstract questions
of the adaptation of means to ends are best left with casuistry. Pike's
methods, while he was the distinguished guest of a half-hostile foreign power,
may be questioned by some, but his motives by none; and as for his ends, we
know that nothing succeeds like success. The results are well summed by his
biographer, p. 282, in words which I will cite:</p>

<p class="footnote">"At the time Captain Pike explored those regions of our wide-spread interior,
almost nothing authentic was known of them. More satisfactory information
of the headwaters of the Mississippi than was in the possession of the public
was highly desirable, and his narratives relating to them were read with interest.
But his accounts of the Mexican territories were looked for with much more
interest, and when they came out were received with avidity. The jealous
policy of Spain had surrounded her provinces with guards and restraints, that
rendered them almost inaccessible. Their condition and prospects were veiled
from all foreign observation; and at the time Captain Pike obtained, through
an unintentional aberration from his prescribed route, access to them, unusual
attention was turned upon the Mexican country by the events of Burr's conspiracy.
This extraordinary transaction had awakened an intense curiosity
respecting a region which was known to abound with gold, and which precious
metal was supposed to have been its ultimate object. The trial of Colonel
Burr was beginning, or in progress, when Captain Pike returned, and was
known to have visited the El Dorado, on which this individual was said to
have fixed an eye of cupidity and ambition. Scarcely anything had been heard
of Mexico since the conquest of Cortes, excepting vague reports of the unbounded
wealth that flowed from its mines into the public and private coffers of
Spain. It is not strange, then, that Captain Pike's tour through some of its
provinces should have been regarded as a rare and most opportune work. His
statements were of course founded on hasty and imperfect observations, it
being obvious from his journal, that, from the time he left Santa Fe, until he
reached the United States, he was under a surveillance, and could only take
notes by stealth. He could neither survey attentively what passed beneath his
eye, nor inquire about that which he did not see, without exciting suspicion and
provoking a rebuke. Still, with an acute eye, and a retentive memory, he
appears to have gathered up many new and interesting facts, that were well
received at the time."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-45" id="Footnote_III-45" href="#FNanchor_III-45"><span class="label">[III-45]</span></a> It is uncertain to what work we are here referred. There may be some
old military treatise, well known in Pike's time, to which he thus alludes; but
I think it most likely that he means his own Observations on New Spain, which
formed a part of the App. to Pt. 3 of the orig. ed. of this work, and which
included a considerable account of the military establishment of that country.
If so, the "Essai Militaire" in question will be found <a href="#Page_718">beyond</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-46" id="Footnote_III-46" href="#FNanchor_III-46"><span class="label">[III-46]</span></a> My editorial function becomes extremely distasteful, with Pike's reiterated
insistence upon affecting to believe himself upon the Red r., and expecting us
to believe him. See <a href="#Footnote_III-44">note<sup>44</sup></a>, and imagine Dr. Robinson starting off alone to
walk from the Red r. into Santa Fé! I have blinked the business thus far, but
I cannot keep my eyes shut to the end of this chapter, as there is worse to come
in the miserable straits to which Captain Pike reduces himself through his
awkwardness and inexperience in telling lies. He bluffs the thing through, to
be sure; but at the present juncture he catches himself in the meshes of his
own falsification. For, supposing he had really been on the Red r., as he
declared he believed; he had <i>crossed that river</i>, and gone 5 m. up a stream on
the other side of it; so he was absolutely in Spanish territory, and this he must
have known perfectly well. On the 22d he says, <a href="#Page_507">p. 507</a>, that he "began to
think it was time we received a visit from the Spaniards or their emissaries,"
which shows that he was expecting to be caught. When they come, he makes
a show of resistance by blustering a little, then hauls down his flag and goes
with them peaceably enough&mdash;probably not only a willing captive, but one who
had all along intended and desired to be taken into the enemy's country for
purposes of his own. And back of this sorry scene there looms the sinister
shadow of General James Wilkinson, the traitor and conspirator with Aaron
Burr&mdash;let the curtain fall.</p>

of the orig. ed., pp. 1-18. This had no number among the various pieces of
which that Appendix was made up; but as it came first, and the next piece was
No. 2, the lack of numeration was a mere inadvertence, and it is to be taken
<i>pro formâ</i> as No. 1. It was lengthily entitled: "A Dissertation On the Soil,
Rivers, Productions, Animal and Vegetable, with General Notes on the Internal
Parts of Louisiana, compiled from observations made by Capt. Z. M. Pike, in a
late tour from the mouth of the Missouri, to the Head Waters of the Arkansaw
and Rio del Norte, in the years 1806 and 1807; including Observations on the
Aborigines of the Country." Such notes as I should otherwise have to offer on
the substance of this Dissertation are for the most part already made in the
foregoing three chapters of the Itinerary. The present chapter may therefore
be passed without remark, excepting in so far as concerns some new points
that come up for notice.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IV-2" id="Footnote_IV-2" href="#FNanchor_IV-2"><span class="label">[IV-2]</span></a> Read Missouri&mdash;"Mississippi" being the slip of a pen which had so often

Pike's wrong conclusion is not here animadverted upon, as it has been set right
before; but I wish to note that the "White river of the Mississippi" has given
rise to much confusion, from the very simple circumstance that it is a branch
both of the Mississippi and of the Arkansaw. It runs into the very crotch
between these two, and has a sort of a delta of its own, as well as a double
debouchment. Various maps consulted on this point, as I have never been on
the spot, differ in that some run White r. into the Arkansaw, some into the
Mississippi, and some into both these rivers. The latter seems to be the
present arrangement; but this may have repeatedly altered in former times.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IV-4" id="Footnote_IV-4" href="#FNanchor_IV-4"><span class="label">[IV-4]</span></a> The route from the Missouri, at or near the mouth of the Kansas&mdash;that
is, from old Westport (now Kansas City), Mo., and Independence, Mo.&mdash;to the
great bend of the Arkansaw, near the mouth of Walnut cr., was established as
an overland highway during the '20's, when it began to be regularly taken by
the traders' caravans en route to Santa Fé. The trade attained such proportions
that some years merchandise of the value of $250,000 and $450,000 was hauled
over this road: see Gregg's statistics for 1822-43, Comm. Pra., II. 1844, p. 160.
Pack-animals or wagons were used, 1822-25, but after that wagons only; and
these soon wore a road as plain as a turnpike. It will be interesting to go over
this road, and identify the camping-grounds of those hardy pioneers by the
modern names of the places on and near their route; especially as no railroad
now follows this primitive trace exactly. It held a pretty straight westward
course, bearing all the while southward; the distance from the usual starting
place (Independence, Mo.) was called 300 m. roundly, but is somewhat less
than this. The most noted point on the route was Council Grove, so called
since 1825, when the U. S. Commissioners Reeves, Sibley, and Mathers, who
there treated with the Osages, gave the place its present name. In the most
general terms, the road followed the divide between Kansan waters on the N.,
or right hand going W., and on the other, first those of the Osage (a branch of
the Missouri), then those of the Neosho (a branch of the Arkansaw), and finally
those of the Arkansaw itself. But the route was nearly everywhere in the
latter water-shed; after the first few miles, every stream crossed ran to the
left. In some places, the divide between the two sets of streams had little
breadth; one place was called The Narrows, the approximation was so close.
The wagon-train that started from Independence usually left "the States" the
first day out, and entered "the Indian territory"&mdash;that is, it went from the
present State of Missouri into the present State of Kansas; and all the rest of
the way to Great Bend was through the latter. Let us look up some maps
and itineraries of half a century ago&mdash;say Gregg's, pub. 1844; Wislizenus', of
1846; and Beckwith's, 1853&mdash;to see what sign-posts they set up. These point
to such places as the following, in regular order from E. to W.: Independence
and Westport, Mo.&mdash;Big Blue camp&mdash;Round Grove, Lone Elm, The Glen&mdash;Bull
cr., Black Jack cr. and pt., Willow springs, and The Narrows&mdash;two Rock
creeks in succession&mdash;One Hundred and Ten Mile cr.&mdash;Bridge cr.&mdash;Dwissler's or
Switzler's cr.&mdash;five creeks to which the names First Dragoon, Second Dragoon,
Soldier, Prairie Chicken, Elm, and One Hundred and Forty-two Mile attach in
some itineraries and are to be collated with Fish and Pool, or Fish and Pleasant
Valley, of others&mdash;Bluff cr.&mdash;Big Rock cr.&mdash;Big John spring and cr.&mdash;<i>Council
Grove</i>, on its own cr.&mdash;another Elm cr.&mdash;Diamond spring and cr.&mdash;Lost spring
and Lost or Willow cr.&mdash;Cottonwood cr.&mdash;two or three Turkey creeks in succession&mdash;Little
Arkansaw r.&mdash;several Little Cow creeks, among them one called
Chavez or Charez and Owl&mdash;Big Cow cr.&mdash;approach to the Arkansaw r. at Camp
Osage&mdash;up the Arkansaw to Walnut cr. and thus to Great Bend. From such
<i>indicia</i> as these it may not be difficult to reopen the road in terms of modern
geography. 1. Independence maintains its independence as the seat of Jackson
Co., Mo., 2 or 3 m. S. of the Missouri r., and about the same E. of Big
Blue cr.; but Westport is practically absorbed in the suburbs of Kansas City,
Mo. Starting from Independence, the first halt on the prairie, after crossing
Big Blue r., was likely to be "Big Blue camp." This was about the heads of
Brush cr., a small tributary of the Big Blue from the W., and in the vicinity of
present Glenn. Being nearly on the present inter-State boundary, it was the
"jumping-off place" from "the States," where the traveler entered "the Indian
territory." The military road between Forts Towson (on Red r.) and Leavenworth
passed by. A little to the N. W. was the Shawnee agency and mission,
on a branch of Turkey cr., the first tributary of the Kansas from the S.;
Shawnee is there now, and other places on Turkey cr. are called Merriam,
South Park, and Rosedale; the Kansas City, Fort Scott, and Gulf R. R.
meanders Turkey cr. into Kansas City. The position is about lat. 38° 59´ N.
and long. 94° 35´ W. 2. About 5 m. further S. W. the road passed by Lenexa,
Johnson Co., and a camp could be made on a head of Indian cr., which is
a small stream joined by Tomahawk cr. before it reaches the Big Blue. The
road continued S. W., approximately by the present S. Kan. R. R., and thus
past Olathe, now seat of Johnson Co., where six tracks diverge in various
directions. This is in the center of the county, near the head of Indian cr., on
the head of Mill cr., a tributary of the Kansas, and near the head of a branch
of Cedar cr., another Kansan affluent. 3. "Round Grove," "Lone Elm," or
"The Glen" was a camping-place on one of the heads of Cedar cr., between
Olathe and the village of Gardner; it was reckoned 15 m. from Big Blue camp,
and 22 m. from Westport. Thus far the Santa Fé route coincided with the even
more celebrated "Oregon trail." But at a point beyond Gardner, in the
direction of Edgerton, and 6 or 8 m. from Round Grove, the road forked&mdash;that
is, the Oregon trail struck off to the right in the N. W. direction of the
Kansas, while the Santa Fé trail kept on the left-hand fork westward. 4. Bull
cr. is still so called, or specified as Big Bull cr. to distinguish it from Little
Bull cr. which, with other tributaries, such as Rock, Ten Mile, and Wea, it
receives before it falls into Marais des Cygnes (main Osage) r. This is the
creek on which is Paola, seat of Miami Co., near the junction of Wea cr., and it
was the first of the Osage waters which the road crossed. The crossing was high
up on its main course, between Gardner and Edgerton, whence the road continued
W. from Johnson into Douglas Co. 5. From the crossing of Bull cr. it
is 9 m. to Black Jack cr. and pt., so called from the kind of oak (<i>Quercus
nigra</i>) which grows there. Black Jack is still the name of a place between the
heads of Captain cr. (tributary of the Kansas) and Rock cr. (a branch of Bull
cr.); it is 3 m. due E. of Baldwin City. 6. "Willow springs" was a noted
camping place W. of Baldwin City, on one of the heads of Ottawa cr., which
flows southward into the Marais des Cygnes r., a little below Ottawa, county
seat of Franklin. The distance of Willow springs from the crossing of Black
Jack cr. is 10½ m. Willow springs seems to be the same place that was called
Wakarusa pt., or was at any rate very near it. Here the approximation of
Kansan and Osage waters is very close, and this is the place which consequently
became known as "The Narrows." The interlocking is between several heads
of the Ottawa cr. just said and some tributaries of Cole cr., a branch of the
Wakarusa. Camp could also be made at a place called Hickory pt., short of
Willow springs by 3 or 4 m. 7. Two "Rock" creeks were passed at distances
given as 9 and 12 m. from Willow springs by some writers, and quite differently
by others; some also mention but one "Rock" cr. Eight Mile cr. was
headed if not crossed by the road; and beyond this the road crossed one or both
heads of Appanoose cr. These creeks are tributaries of the Marais des Cygnes,
falling in a mile apart at Ottawa and just beyond. Part of the uncertainty
about these "Rock" creeks arose from the fact that they often ran dry, were
woodless, and thus ineligible for camping-grounds; hence they would often be
passed without remark. The names seem to me to apply rather to the two
forks of the Appanoose than to the main fork of the latter and to Eight Mile cr.
8. One Hundred and Ten Mile cr., which still floats its long name, was so
called because it was taken to be 110 m. from Fort Osage, our earliest establishment
of the kind on the Missouri. This was built in Sept., 1808, at Fort
Point (present Sibley: see L. and C., ed. 1893, p. 30), and was sometimes called
Fort Clark. The creek in mention was crossed at a point taken to be 24 m. from
Willow springs, and thus in the vicinity of present Scranton, Osage Co. It is
a branch of the Dragoon cr. we have next to consider. 9. Continuing nearly
due W., the road crossed several heads of present Dragoon cr., in the vicinity
of Burlingame, Osage Co. This is a comparatively large creek, which runs
southeastward to fall into the Marais des Cygnes near Quenemo. That one of
the several heads of Dragoon cr. on which Burlingame is situated is now called
Switzler's cr.; the next beyond is the main source of Dragoon cr., into which
a branch called Soldier's cr. falls, about 2 m. W. of Burlingame. But none of
the older itineraries I have consulted speak of either "Dragoon" or "Soldier's"
cr.; instead of which, they give a certain Bridge cr., as crossed 8 m. W. of One
Hundred and Ten Mile cr. This is precisely the distance given by Beckwith
for his "Dwissler's" cr. No doubt "Switzler" and "Dwissler" are the same
person's names; but whether this has always been applied to the same creek
may well be doubted. The "First Dragoon" cr. is now Dragoon cr.; the
"Second Dragoon" cr. is now Soldier's cr.; these were passed near their confluence.
10. In the next few miles the road crossed in rapid succession several
heads of the Marais des Cygnes itself, thus finishing with the Osage water-shed.
Three of these are now known as Onion, Chicken or Prairie Chicken, and
Elm; the latter is the main head, and seems to be the one which appears as
"Fish" cr. in the early narratives&mdash;the name by which it is mapped both by
Gregg and by Wislizenus. A fourth head of the Marais des Cygnes which the
road crossed is that now known as One Hundred and Forty-two Mile cr., which
joins the main stream much lower down than the other three. This is mapped
by Gregg as Pool cr. and by Wislizenus as Pleasant Valley cr. All four of
these streams are crossed in Lyon Co., the boundary between this and Osage
Co. having been passed at long. 95° 50´ 57´´ W. nearly. 11. The road continued
across Big Rock cr., having first passed its branch, Bluff cr. This is a tributary
of the Neosho. It is probable that the Bluff cr. of early writers refers to the
main Big Rock rather than to the branch now called Bluff, as it is the last one
they give before coming to&mdash;12. Big John cr., another tributary of the Neosho,
which was crossed immediately before Council Grove was reached; on which
account, as well as for its beautiful spring and eligible camping-ground, it early
became noted under the name it still bears. 13. Council Grove, now the seat
of Morris Co. This was always the most marked place on the route&mdash;a sort of
halfway station between the Missouri settlements and the great bend of the
Arkansaw. Its area was indefinitely extensive along the wooded bottom-land of
the Neosho, or, as it was called here, Council Grove cr.; but as the situation
became peopled, settlement was made chiefly on the W. or right bank of the
stream, at the mouth of Elm cr., a tributary from the W. This is not far from
the center of a tract about 45 m. square known as the Kansas Trust Lands, of
which the Kansas Diminished Reserve is a southwestern portion. Council
Grove is only some 8 m. from the boundary between Lyon and Morris Co.,
which runs on a meridian close by the course of Big Rock cr. 14. The road
continued W. up the left or N. bank of Elm cr. for about 8 m., crossed it at or
near present station Milton of the Topeka, Salina, and Western R. R., and
went on S. W. to Diamond spring, about 8 m. further. This was a camping
place high up on the waters of Diamond or, as it is also called, Six Mile cr.,
a branch of the Cottonwood. 15. Hence W. about 16 m. to Lost spring, on
Lost or Clear cr.&mdash;that branch of the Cottonwood which falls in at Marion.
This place is a little over the border of Marion Co., and a town or station Lost
Spring perpetuates the name, at the point where the Chicago, Kansas, and
Nebraska R. R. crosses a branch of the A., T., and S. F. R. R. 16. From
Lost spring the route turned S. W. 17 m. to the Cottonwood, approximately by
the present railroad line, and struck that river at or near Durham, Marion Co.
17. Continuing S. W. and then bearing more nearly W., the road passed by or
near Canton and thence to McPherson, both in the county of the latter name.
Both are situated among the heads of Turkey cr., a branch of the Little
Arkansaw; two or three of these were crossed. When two were noted, it used
to be by the names of Little and Big Turkey creeks; map names are now
Running Turkey, Turkey, and West Turkey; McPherson is on the last of
these, some 25 m. from the crossing of the Cottonwood. The Turkey creeks
vary very much in character with season and the weather. 18. The road continued
about 20 m. to the crossing of the Little Arkansaw, in the vicinity of the
place now called Little River. 19. In 10 m. the road reached one of the
tributaries of Cow cr., and it was 10 more before all of these were passed; there
are five or six of them, and some hardly ever run water. One of them is now
called "Jarvis" cr.: see <a href="#Footnote_II-10">note<sup>10</sup>, p. 424</a>. Another is known as Long Branch;
between this and Little Cow cr. is Lyons, seat of Rice Co., and beyond this
Big Cow cr. is crossed. 20. The road now makes for the Arkansaw on a due
W. course, and comes on to that river at a place which was known as Camp
Osage, in the vicinity of present Ellinwood, Barton Co. This town is only
3 m. from the mouth of Walnut cr., and the city of Great Bend is a mile or
two beyond that.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IV-5" id="Footnote_IV-5" href="#FNanchor_IV-5"><span class="label">[IV-5]</span></a> This wild notion was a pet of Pike's, which he indulged to the extent of
embodying it in the title of his book, and making his map fit it. No man can
go, afoot or on horseback, in anything like one day, from any possible position,
to the sources of all those rivers. It can be taken as an indication of the really
close approximation of certain pairs of rivers, which drain from opposite sides of
the same range, or made elastic enough to suit the situation about Mt. Lincoln,
where some heads of the Grand, the Arkansaw, and the South Platte approximate;
but the other rivers are entirely out of the question. Owing to Pike's
ignorance of the existence of the <i>North</i> Platte, all that he says in various places
of his hypothetical Yellowstone comes nearer the facts in the case of the Platte.
"La Platte" he only knew from the sources of the <i>South</i> Platte.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IV-6" id="Footnote_IV-6" href="#FNanchor_IV-6"><span class="label">[IV-6]</span></a> This "Mr. M'Cartie" was Le Chevalier Macarty, Makarty, etc., who in
1751 succeeded Le Sieur de St. Clair as major-commandant of the Illinois. He
was by birth an Irishman, became a major of engineers, and served about nine
years in the position indicated. The far-famed Fort Chartres is called by Wallace
"the only great architectural work of the French in the entire basin of the
Mississippi, over which, in succession, had proudly floated the flags of two powerful
nations." Old Fort Chartres, or De Chartres, supposed to have been so
named for the Duc de Chartres, son of the then Regent of France, was built in
1719 and 1720, under the direction of Pierre Duqué de Boisbriant, the king's
lieutenant for France, at the expense of the Company of the West; it at once
became military headquarters and the center of authority, and was long prominent
in the French history of Illinois. It was rebuilt in 1753-56 during
Major Macarty's incumbency, upon the plans of the French engineer Saucier, at
an estimated cost of 5,000,000 livres; and this "new Chartres" is described
as a "huge structure of masonry, an object of wonder and curiosity to all who
ever beheld it"&mdash;some of these being antiquarians of the present day. The historic
fortress suffered encroachments of the Mississippi for several years; it was
finally dilapidated during a freshet in 1772, then evacuated by the British garrison,
which removed to Fort Gage, and never reoccupied. We have many
memorials of the progress of its decay, as well as of the period of its greatness:
see Wallace's Illinois and Louisiana under French rule, 1893, pp. 270, 271,
313-318, which include various important references, notably to Pittman, whose
description of the fort as it was in 1766 is transcribed, and to Beck's Gazetteer,
giving a plan of the fort from observations made in 1820. The name stands for
a steamboat landing near Prairie du Rocher, Randolph Co., Ill.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-1" id="Footnote_V-1" href="#FNanchor_V-1"><span class="label">[V-1]</span></a> The following Report was written by Lieutenant Wilkinson at a time when
it was expected I had been cut off by the savages. It consequently alluded to
transactions relative to the Expedition previous to our separation, which I have
since corrected. But the adventures of his party, after our separation, are given
in his own words.&mdash;Z. M. P.</p>

<p class="footnote">The above explanatory note by Pike stood alone on p. 19 of the App. to
Pt. 2 of the orig. ed. Wilkinson's Report, of which Chapter V. now consists,
formed Doc. No. 2 of that Appendix, running pp. 20-32. It rehearses the
movements of Pike's party to Oct. 28th, 1806, when the two officers separated
at Great Bend, and Wilkinson started down the Arkansaw. It thus serves to
some extent to check Pike's narrative, but is chiefly notable in this respect for
some discrepancies which I have been unable to adjust. Lieutenant Wilkinson's
health was not good during his descent of the Arkansaw, and he endured
much hardship; to which causes is doubtless due in part the lack of anything
very notable in his Report. James Biddle Wilkinson was the son of General
James Wilkinson of Maryland. He entered the army as a second lieutenant of
the 4th Infantry, Feb. 16th, 1801; was transferred to the 2d Infantry, Apr.
1st, 1802; became first lieutenant Sept. 30th, 1803, and captain Oct. 8th, 1808,
and died Sept. 7th, 1813.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-2" id="Footnote_V-2" href="#FNanchor_V-2"><span class="label">[V-2]</span></a> The toise is an old French measure of length equal to six French feet or

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-3" id="Footnote_V-3" href="#FNanchor_V-3"><span class="label">[V-3]</span></a> The party reached and crossed the Neosho <a href="#Page_399">Sept. 9th</a>, and struck the Smoky
Hill fork of the Kansas r. on the morning of <a href="#Page_403">the 16th</a>: see those dates in
Pike's itinerary, and notes there.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-4" id="Footnote_V-4" href="#FNanchor_V-4"><span class="label">[V-4]</span></a> There are material discrepancies between Wilkinson's and Pike's accounts
of the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th, not easy to reconcile, even supposing the two
officers were separated a part of the time. Pike comes first to what he calls
"Little Saline" r., and then to Great Saline on the 11th; Smoky Hill r.,
12th; 7 m. beyond it to head of a branch of it, 13th; over the divide, 14th,
to Cow cr.; and is lost on Walnut cr., 15th. His map puts a camp-mark on
Little Saline, date uncertain; one on Great Saline, 11th; one on Smoky
Hill r., 12th; and none for 13th, 14th, or 15th. Wilkinson comes first to Grand
Saline, 11th; "Second or Small Saline," 12th; Smoky Hill, 13th; over divide
and on to a branch of the Arkansaw, also on the 13th; reaches Arkansaw 14th,
about midnight. We have here a day miscounted; reverse sequence of the two
Saline rivers; and several camp-marks misplaced or missing. All this adds
to the trouble we found in trying to follow Pike's itinerary, and I do not see
how the difficulty can be adjusted. What seems certain is: 1. Great Saline r.
reached or crossed on the 11th; Smoky Hill r. reached or crossed on the 12th;
divide crossed and camp on Cow cr., 13th, 14th; Wilkinson on the Arkansaw
at midnight of the 15th, when Pike and Robinson were lost on Walnut cr.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-5" id="Footnote_V-5" href="#FNanchor_V-5"><span class="label">[V-5]</span></a> Again a discrepancy from Pike. According to his diary he left the party at
5 p. m., 15th, with Dr. Robinson; was lost, 16th and 17th; found and brought
to Wilkinson's camp on the Arkansaw, 18th; so Wilkinson could have remained
but two days in suspense, which was relieved on the third day. As Pike himself
informs us that he "corrected" Wilkinson's Report for the time they were
together, yet evidently failed to make it fit his own, we may be excused if we
do not succeed in the attempt. On some points I suspect Wilkinson came nearest
the facts. He did not lose his notes and supplement from memory, as Pike was
forced to do; he was not hunting for the Spanish trail, nor for buffalo; and he
did not get bewildered on Walnut cr.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-6" id="Footnote_V-6" href="#FNanchor_V-6"><span class="label">[V-6]</span></a> Both accounts fortunately agree on this notable date&mdash;the day on which Pike
started up the Arkansaw and Wilkinson down the same river. The distance
made by the latter on the 28th sets him about the mouth of Antelope cr., a
small run that makes in on the right or south a mile above the mouth of Walnut
cr. Here he remained on the 29th and 30th. There is obviously no
possibility of following him closely through his benumbed voyage; we can only
check his course at the most notable points.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-7" id="Footnote_V-7" href="#FNanchor_V-7"><span class="label">[V-7]<br />
[V-8]</span></a> Wilkinson's, "bold running stream" and his "large creek" are probably
identifiable by the above data; but in my ignorance of these details I can
only presume, without knowing, that he means Cow cr. and the Little Arkansaw,
these being the two principal tributaries of the Arkansaw in Kansas below
Great Bend. Cow cr. is the same stream whose headwaters Pike and Wilkinson
came upon before they reached Great Bend: see <a href="#Footnote_II-10">note<sup>10</sup>, p. 424</a>; but it falls
in much lower, at Hutchinson, Reno Co., Kas. The Little Arkansaw is that
river at whose mouth is Wichita, seat of Sedgwick Co., Kas. Both these
streams course very obliquely to the Arkansaw, from the N. W., and fall in on
the left bank.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-9" id="Footnote_V-9" href="#FNanchor_V-9"><span class="label">[V-9]</span></a> "Negracka" is here an error; Wilkinson means the Ninnescah, Nenescah,
or Nenesquaw r., which falls in from the W. on the right hand; town of Whitman,
Sumner Co., Kas., at its mouth. This is the only instance I have ever
known of the misapplication of the name Negracka, which belongs absolutely to,
and was long the current name of, the Salt fork of the Arkansaw: see <a href="#Footnote_V-10">next
note</a>. Thus, we read in Morse's Gazetteer, 1821, p. 499: "Negracka River
... falls into the Arkansaw from the N. W. It is 100 yards wide." The
Nenescah is a smaller stream than this. It is lettered "Ne-ne-sesh, or Good
Riv." on a map of the Indian Terr., etc., Engineer Bureau, War Dept., Oct.,
1866. Between his Negracka or the Nenescah r., and his Neskalonska or the
Salt fork of the Arkansaw, Wilkinson passes the following streams: 1. Slate
cr., from the N. W., traversing Sumner Co. obliquely; 2. Walnut cr. (formerly
Whitewater r.), from the N., with an average course nearly due S., through
Butler and Cowley cos., Kas., to fall in at Arkansaw City; 3. Grouse cr., from
the N. E., in Cowley Co., its mouth nearly on the boundary between Kansas
and Oklahoma; 4. Chilockey or Chilocco cr., over the Oklahoma line, school
reservation there; 5. Deer cr., from the W., very small; 6. Beaver cr., from
the N. E., whose mouth is at the Kaw or Kansas Agency; 7. South Coon cr.,
from the N., but falling in on the right, very small; 8. Turkey cr., from the
N., but mouth on the right, between Cross and Ponca stations of the Arkansaw
branch of the A., T., and S. F. R. R.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-10" id="Footnote_V-10" href="#FNanchor_V-10"><span class="label">[V-10]</span></a> "Neskalonska" is a name I have failed to find elsewhere, but fortunately
there is no question of the river to which Wilkinson applies it. This is Salt
fork, the third largest branch of the Arkansaw from the W.&mdash;the Cimarron
being second, and the Canadian first in size. Wilkinson's "Neskalonska" and
his "Grand Saline or Newsewtonga" are respectively Salt fork and Cimarron r.
of present nomenclature. Notwithstanding their great size and importance,
and the fact that they fall into the Arkansaw about a degree of latitude and
of longitude apart, they have been completely confused by geographers, on whose
maps almost every name of each has been misapplied to the other. Salt fork is
the upper and smaller one of the two, which falls in through the Ponca Reservation,
at or near Ponca P. O. and Ponca Agency, in Oklahoma. Cimarron r. is
the lower and larger one of the two, which falls in through the Indian Territory
at a point on the boundary of Oklahoma. Salt fork has been called:
Salt fork; Salt r.; Salt cr.; Saline fork; Saline r.; Saline cr.; Red fork; Red
r.; Little Arkansaw r. (duplicating a name: see <a href="#Footnote_V-7">note<sup>8</sup>, p. 548</a>); Nescutango r.;
Negracka r. (its usual name for many years); Semerone, Cimarone, Cimmaron,
Cimarron r.&mdash;the last four variants of the same word, and like Nescutango,
properly belonging only to the next, viz.: Cimarron r. This has been called:
Red fork; Saline r.; Grand Saline r.; Jefferson r.; Nesuketong, Nesuketonga,
Nesuhetonga, Nescutanga, Newsewketonga r.; Cimmaron, Cimarron r. On
analyzing the comparative applicability of these names, I find that "Salt" or
"Saline" belongs most properly to the upper and smaller stream, for which we
now use it, and when applied to the lower is usually qualified as Grand Saline;
that "Red" is misapplied to both indifferently; that "Little Arkansas" is
only applied to the upper, and "Jefferson" only to the lower stream; that
"Negracka" is absolutely the name of the upper one alone; that "Nesuketonga"
and its variants are almost entirely confined to the lower one; and
finally that "Cimarron" in its variations is equally common to both, though in
present usage it is absolutely restricted to the lower one.</p>

<p class="footnote">These data rest upon the examination of a large lot of old maps with
special reference to the points involved, with the assistance of Mr. Robert F.
Thompson of the Indian Bureau at Washington. These maps show a curious
reversal in the <i>size</i> of the two rivers, the earlier and poorer ones making the
upper stream the larger of the two, and conversely. Furthermore, the tendency
has always been to call the <i>larger</i> one "Cimarron" and "Red," no matter
which its position. Aside from this, the most sharply contrasted pairs of
names are "Salt" and "Negracka" for the upper stream, and "Red" and
"Nesuketonga" for the lower one. Thus, to be more specific: 1. John Melish's
map of the U. S., engr. by J. Vallance and H. S. Tanner, pub. Philada., 1820,
has Negracka, upper, larger; Jefferson, lower, smaller. 2. H. S. Tanner's
map of N. Amer., in the New American Atlas, pub. Philada., 1823, map dated
1822, has Negracka or Red r., upper, larger; and Nesuhetonga or Gr. Saline,
lower, smaller. 3. The American Atlas, pub. Philada., H. C. Carey and I.
Lea, 1823, has a map of the U. S., with Negracka or Red Fork, upper, larger,
and Grand Saline, lower, smaller; also, a map of the Arkansaw, etc., drawn by
Major S. H. Long, with Negracka or Red Fork, upper, larger; and Nesuketonga
or Grand Saline, lower, smaller; also, a map of Mexico, etc., based on
Humboldt, etc., by J. Finlayson, with these very same names. 4. A. Finlay's
map of North America, pub. Philada., 1826, has upper larger stream Negracka
or Semerone R.; lower one, very small, Grand Saline. 5. A map of Mexico in
Anthony Finlay's Atlas, pub. Philada., 1830, has Negracka, upper and larger;
the lower smaller one unnamed. 6. A map of North America in Tanner's
Atlas, pub. Philada., Carey and Hart, 1843, has Negracka, upper and larger;
Gr. Saline, lower and smaller; the map of Mexico and Guatemala, in this atlas,
represents the two as Red Br. and Saline. 7. On Josiah Gregg's map of the
Indian Territory, etc., in Morse's N. A. Atlas, pub. N. Y., Harper and Brothers,
1844, also accompanying Gregg's Commerce of the Prairies, the two rivers are
represented of about the same size, the upper one being lettered Cimarron R.
and Salt Fork; the lower, Red Fork of the Arkansas R. This is a notably
good map for its date, and in the matter now under examination may be taken
as the turning-point to a better understanding of the facts in the case. 8. On
a map of Texas, etc., pub. Philada., S. Augustus Mitchell, 1846, the upper and
still larger river appears as Cimarone or Salt Fork; the lower, as Red Fork.
9. On a map of Mexico issued by H. S. Tanner, 3d ed., 1846, the upper,
larger stream is given as Semerone, Negracka, or Red River; the lower, as
Saline. 10. On a map of the U. S. in Harper's Statistical Gazetteer of the World,
by J. Calvin Smith, pub. N. Y., Harper and Brothers, 1855, the upper stream
is called Cimarron or Salt Fork; the lower, Red Fork of Arkansas. 11.
Emory's beautiful map of the Western U. S., pub. 1857-58, has Salt Fork
for the upper and much smaller stream, and Red Fork of the Arkansas for
the other. 12. A map of Kansas, etc., in Mitchell's Atlas of 1861, represents the
upper stream as Cimarron River, the lower as Red Fork of the Arkansas.
13. The map of N. A. in Johnston's Family Atlas, pub. N. Y., Johnston and
Ward, 1864, shows the two in a peculiar manner, and calls the upper one
Semerone, the lower one Nesuketong. 14. The Office of Indian Affairs has
on file a very fine map of the Indian Territory, drawn by Ado Hunnius from
the reconnoissance of Lieutenant J. C. Woodruff in 1852, and from a War
Dept. map of 1866, on which the upper and now <i>smaller</i> river appears as Salt
Creek or Nescutanga, or Salt Fork of the Arkansas, and the much larger lower
one as Cimarron River or Red Fork of the Arkansas. 15. The War Dept.
map of the Indian Territory, Engineer Bureau, Oct., 1866, letters for the
smaller upper stream Nescutango R. and Little Arkansas R.; for the other,
Cimarron River and Red Fork of Arkansas River. 16. A manuscript map by
John C. McCoy, on file in the Office of Indian Affairs, has Red Fork for the
upper, and Ne se ke tonga for the lower one. 17. On a cabinet map of the
U. S., pub. Chicago, Rufus Blanchard, 1868, the upper one is called Little
Arkansas River, the lower one being styled Red Fork of Arkansas River.
18. A map of the U. S. in Mitchell's Atlas of 1874 shows the upper and larger
stream as Cimmaron or Salt Fork, and the smaller lower one as Red Fork;
the map of Texas in the same atlas shows only the latter, given as Red Fork
of Arkansas. 19. The General Land Office map of the Indian Territory, 1879,
letters for the upper river Salt Fork of Arkansas R., and for the other Red Fork
of the Arkansas or Cimarron River; the same Office's map of Oklahoma, 1894,
has Salt Fork of Arkansas River for the one, and Cimarron River for the other.</p>

<p class="footnote">The consensus of the above, aside from the eccentricities and errors involved,
is reducible to Salt fork or Negracka r. for the upper one, and Red fork,
Nesuketonga, or Cimarron r. for the other one, of these two important streams.
One of the curiosities in the matter is the constancy of the form of the word
Negracka, as well as its restriction to a single river.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-11" id="Footnote_V-11" href="#FNanchor_V-11"><span class="label">[V-11]</span></a> The Verdigris, Vermilion, or Wasetihoge r. has been already noticed, when
Pike's party reached its headwaters in Kansas: see <a href="#Footnote_I-58">note<sup>58</sup>, p. 400</a>. The present
nomenclature of its principal branches is: 1. Hominy cr., in the Osage and
Cherokee countries of the Indian Territory, with a main fork, Bird cr., site of
the Osage Agency; 2. Caney r., or the Little Verdigris, falling in by the Blue
Mounds in the Cherokee country, and formed of two main forks known as Big
and Little Caney creeks, both of which head in Kansas; 3. Elk r., heading in
the Kansan county of that name, and falling in above Independence, in Montgomery
Co., Kas.; 4. Fall r., one of the terminal forks of the Verdigris, and on
which is Fredonia, Wilson Co.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-12" id="Footnote_V-12" href="#FNanchor_V-12"><span class="label">[V-12]</span></a> See <a href="#Footnote_V-10">note<sup>10</sup></a> for synonymy. The Cimarron is a very large river, which
drains from the eastern slopes of the great mountains in New Mexico and runs
thence through southwestern portions of Kansas, loops into Oklahoma Territory
from Meade Co., Kas., loops back into Kansas in Clarke Co., and thence
through the S. W. corner of Comanche Co. into Oklahoma again, traverses this
Territory, and joins the Arkansaw between the Osage and Creek countries, at
a certain point on the line between Oklahoma and the Indian Territory.</p>

<p class="footnote">In passing from Salt fork to the Cimarron, we have first, Red or Red Rock
cr., a sizable stream from the W. or right; places called Redrock and Otoe on
it; second, Buck cr., left, from the N., once known as Suicide cr.; third, Gray
Horse cr., small, left, from the N. E.; fourth, Black Bear cr., large, from the
W., on the right. The Pawnee Agency is on this stream, which some maps
wrongly run into the Cimarron instead of the Arkansaw.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-13" id="Footnote_V-13" href="#FNanchor_V-13"><span class="label">[V-13]</span></a> This is not easily determined, as there are several small streams of similar
character between the Cimarron and the Verdigris, among them those called
Polecat, Snake, Cane, and Caney (or Pocan) creeks.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-14" id="Footnote_V-14" href="#FNanchor_V-14"><span class="label">[V-14]</span></a> For these two rivers, see back, <a href="#Footnote_I-53">notes<sup>53</sup></a>, <a href="#Footnote_I-55"><sup>55</sup></a>, pp. <a href="#Page_397">397</a>, <a href="#Page_398">398</a>, and following to

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-15" id="Footnote_V-15" href="#FNanchor_V-15"><span class="label">[V-15]</span></a> This was the so-called "Arkansaw band" of Osages, the circumstances of
whose secession from the Osage village on the Little Osage r. are mentioned
by Pike elsewhere, as well as by Wilkinson in the present instance. The
faction seems to have been fomented by Chouteau through jealousy of Lisa's
exclusive right to trade on the Osage r. The affair must have been notorious
at the time, as various authors speak of the settlement of this Osage band on the
Verdigris or, as it was also called, Vermilion r. Among them are Lewis and
Clark: see ed. 1893, p. 12.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-16" id="Footnote_V-16" href="#FNanchor_V-16"><span class="label">[V-16]</span></a> This Illinois r., still so called, heads in Washington and Benton cos., Ark.,
crosses the W. border of the State N. of 36°, and runs through the Cherokee
country in the Indian Territory, to fall into the Arkansaw a short distance
above the mouth of the Canadian. Between the Illinois and Canadian rivers,
on the E. side of the Arkansaw, opposite the mouth of Elk cr., is a place
called Webber's Falls, with reference to the falls of which Wilkinson speaks.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-17" id="Footnote_V-17" href="#FNanchor_V-17"><span class="label">[V-17]</span></a> The main fork of the Arkansaw, and scarcely a lesser stream. This is one
of the six or seven large rivers which have shared the name "Red" or its
equivalent, though less frequently than some of the others. This is because the
Mexicans called it Rio Colorado at its headwaters, which they knew very well;
and because, down to 1820, these were supposed to be those of the true "Red
river of Natchitoches," a branch of the Mississippi. The discovery that this
Rio Colorado or Red r. was the source of the Canadian was made by Major
Long, who followed it down, thinking he was on the Red r. of Natchitoches,
and was not undeceived till he found its confluence with the Arkansaw. This
is noted in 1844 by Gregg, and in 1855 by Warren; it was the third attempt
made by the United States Government to discover the sources of the true Red
r., Captain Sparks having been first, in 1806, and Pike second. "Canadian," as
applied to the main fork of the Arkansaw, has no more to do with the Dominion
of Canada in history or politics than it has in geography, and many have wondered
how this river came to be called the Canadian. The word is from the
Spanish Rio Cañada, or Rio Cañadiano, through such a form as Rio Cañadian,
whence directly "Canadian" r., meaning "Cañon" r., and referring to the
way in which the stream is boxed up or shut in by precipitous walls near its
headwaters. These drain from E. slopes of the Raton and other great mountains
in New Mexico E. of Taos and Santa Fé, by such streams as the Vermijo
(Bermejo), Little Cimarron, Pouñel or Poñi, Rayado, and Ocaté, which join
above the cañada, and the Moro, which falls in further down. Leaving New
Mexico the great river courses eastward through Texas, enters Oklahoma at
long. 100° W. (near lat. 36° N., vicinity of Antelope hills), traverses this territory
to about long. 98° W., separates it from the Indian Territory to beyond
long. 97° W., and runs in the latter to join the Arkansaw near long. 95° W., in
the vicinity of Webber's falls, at a point on the boundary between the Cherokee
and Chocktaw countries, about 40 m. E. of the Arkansaw State line. Its principal
branch is the North fork, which as far as it goes is a parallel stream, skirting
the Canadian for hundreds of miles at no great distance northward of the
main stream.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-18" id="Footnote_V-18" href="#FNanchor_V-18"><span class="label">[V-18]</span></a> Poteau or Potteau r. marks a notable point in this barren itinerary, as it
falls in on the boundary between the Indian Territory and Arkansas, immediately
above the important and well-known Fort Smith. This is situated on the
right bank of the Arkansaw, in Sebastian Co., which the river divides from
Crawford Co. Poteau is F. for post, and the name may refer to some early
landmark of that sort: see <a href="#Footnote_I-33">note<sup>33</sup>, p. 378</a>. Small tributaries of the Arkansaw
between the Canadian and Poteau rivers are Vine cr., left; Sans Bois and Cache
creeks, right; Sallison and Skin creeks, left&mdash;in the order here named.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-19" id="Footnote_V-19" href="#FNanchor_V-19"><span class="label">[V-19]</span></a> Wilkinson's "river au Millieu" is apparently that now called Lee or Lee's
cr., which makes in between Fort Smith and Van Buren, seat of Crawford Co.
It courses mostly in Arkansaw, but loops into and out of the Indian Territory.
Four of its branches are called Cove, Brushy, Webber, and Garrison. The F.
phrase Rivière au Milieu, equivalent to "Middle" or "Half-way" r., does not
seem to have been much used anywhere in the U. S., though it is a still current
voyageurs' designation of several different streams in British America.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-20" id="Footnote_V-20" href="#FNanchor_V-20"><span class="label">[V-20]</span></a> For the Quapaw or Kwapa Indians, see L. and C., ed. 1893, pp. 12 and
98, notes. Together with the Kansas, Osages, Omahas, and Poncas, they constitute
a division of the Siouan stock called Dhegiha&mdash;a word equivalent to
"autochthon." Dr. Sibley gives the names of the three Kwapa villages as
Tawanima, Oufotu, and Ocapa: London ed. 1807, p. 53. Quapaw, Kwapa,
Ocapa, Oguoppa, Quappa, Kappa, Ukaqpa, etc., are all forms of their name
of themselves, meaning "those who went down river." Our knowledge of the
village is traced back to Joliet and Marquette, July, 1673; the name Akansa,
adopted in some form by the French, is what the Kwapas were called by the
Illinois Indians, and the origin of our Arkansas or Arkansaw. The form
Acanza is found on Vaugondy's map, 1783. About 230 Kwapas still live in
Oklahoma and the Indian Territory.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-21" id="Footnote_V-21" href="#FNanchor_V-21"><span class="label">[V-21]</span></a> Arkansas Post perpetuates the name of the oldest establishment of whites
in the lower Mississippi valley. The present village is on the N. bank of the
Arkansaw r., in the county and State of Arkansas, 73 m. S. E. of Little Rock,
the capital. Though never a locality of much importance, its place in history
is secure and permanent. Early in the year 1685, Henri de Tonti, the famous
trusty lieutenant of La Salle, was reinstated in command of Fort St. Louis of
the Illinois, with titles of captain and governor, by order of the French king
Louis XIV. Tonti learned that La Salle was in trouble somewhere in New
Spain (Texas), and organized an expedition for his relief. On Feb. 16th, 1686,
he left Fort St. Louis, with 30 Frenchmen and 5 Indians, descended the Illinois
and Miss. rivers to the Gulf, and scoured the coast for miles, but saw no
sign of his great chief. He wrote a letter for La Salle, which he committed to
the care of a chief of the Quinipissas for delivery, should opportunity offer, and
retraced his way up the Miss. r. to the mouth of the Arkansaw, which latter
river he ascended to the village of the Arkensa Indians. There, on lands
which La Salle had already granted him, he stationed six of his men, who volunteered
to remain in hopes of hearing from the distant commander. This was
the origin of the Poste aux Arkansas. La Salle was murdered by the traitor
Duhaut, one of several ruffians among his own men who conspired to his
foul assassination, some say on one of the tributaries of the Brazos, at a spot
which has been supposed to be perhaps 40-50 m. N. of present town of Washington,
Tex.; the date is Mar. 19th or 20th, 1687. Seven of the survivors of
La Salle's ill-starred colony at Fort St. Louis of Texas, reached Arkansas
Post after a journey computed at the time to have been 250 leagues, in the
summer of 1687, and found Couture and De Launay, two of the six whom
Tonti had stationed there the year before. (See Wallace, Hist. Ill. and La.,
etc., 1893.) This Tonti (or Tonty), b. about 1650, died at Mobile, 1704, was
the son of Lorenzo Tonti, who devised the Tontine scheme or policy of life
insurance. Arkansas Post was the scene of Laclede's death, June 20th, 1778.
The place was taken by the Unionists from the Confederates, Jan. 11th, 1863.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VI-1" id="Footnote_VI-1" href="#FNanchor_VI-1"><span class="label">[VI-1]</span></a> General Wilkinson's instructions to Lieutenant Pike were conveyed in the
form of two letters, of June 24th and July 12th, respectively, made in the orig.
ed. pp. 107-110 of main text of Pt. 2, though they were set in smaller type as
a sort of preface or introduction. But as no such preliminary is observed in the
other two parts of the book, and as these orders are in the form of letters from
the general to his lieutenant, I think they are preferably brought in here. By
this single transposition the whole of the correspondence relating to the Arkansaw
expedition is brought together in chronological order to form the present
Chapter VI.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VI-2" id="Footnote_VI-2" href="#FNanchor_VI-2"><span class="label">[VI-2]</span></a> On the subject of our then strained relations with New Spain I have examined
much unpublished manuscript in the Archives of the Government at Washington,
but most of it has become a matter of well-known history, needless to
bring up here. It is well understood that Pike had secret instructions from the
traitor, General Wilkinson, over and beyond those which were ostensible; and
no doubt the main purpose of his Expedition was to open the way to Santa
Fé, with reference to such military operations as then seemed probable. It is
certain that General Wilkinson contemplated the possibility if not the probability
of invading New Mexico. Take as evidence the following extract of a
letter he wrote to the Secretary of War, dated St. Louis, Nov. 26th, 1805:</p>

<p class="footnote">" ... Our situation at New Orleans is a defenceless one, &amp; Colonel Freeman's
removal of two Companies from Fort Adams to that city leaves us without
the means of offence above Batton Rouge, which I do [not] like, but Freeman
felt himself too feeble to stand alone without those Companies&mdash;I most
ardently implore we may not be forced to War, because I seek repose &amp;
we are not indeed prepared for it, that is against European troops&mdash;yet if we
must draw the sword, the whole of the troops destined to operate West of the
Mississippi should be mounted, whether Gun-men or sword-men, because every
Man of the Enemy will be found on Horse Back, and the composition should be
such as I have described in a former Letter&mdash;If any thing should be done from
this Quarter direct, and I might be indulged to recommend my officers, to plan
&amp; Lead the expedition. If I do not reduce New Mexico, at least, in one Campaign,
I will forfeit my Head."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VI-3" id="Footnote_VI-3" href="#FNanchor_VI-3"><span class="label">[VI-3]</span></a> Art. 3 bears the same number that this piece had in the orig. ed., and the
same is the case with all the following articles of the present chapter, with one
exception, where transposition of Orig. Nos. 8 and 9 to make Arts. 9 and 8 is
required to preserve the chronological order. All these letters are from Pike to
Wilkinson, excepting my Art. 8, Orig. No. 9, which is from Wilkinson to Pike,
and one to General Dearborn. Pike's letters are in the nature of reports of
progress to his commanding general and the Secretary of War. They ceased, of
course, upon his separation from Lieutenant Wilkinson, and nothing further was
heard of or from him till his return from Mexico, in July, 1807.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VI-4" id="Footnote_VI-4" href="#FNanchor_VI-4"><span class="label">[VI-4]</span></a> There is no allusion to this matter in the letter as originally printed, where
a long row of asterisks indicates the elision of what it was not thought prudent
to publish at that time.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VI-5" id="Footnote_VI-5" href="#FNanchor_VI-5"><span class="label">[VI-5]</span></a> There were two Bissells, both of Connecticut, and of the same or similar
rank in the army, often confused in records of the time, unless their first names
are given, as in this instance; 1. Daniel Bissell became an ensign in the 1st
Infantry, Apr. 11th, 1792; was arranged to the 1st sub-Legion Sept. 4th, 1792;
promoted to a lieutenancy Jan. 3d, 1794; assigned to the 1st Infantry Nov. 1st,
1796; made a captain Jan. 1st, 1799; lieutenant-colonel, 1st Infantry, Aug.
18th, 1808; colonel, 5th Infantry, Aug. 15th, 1812; brigadier-general, Mar.
9th, 1814; honorably discharged June 1st, 1821, and died Dec. 14th, 1833.
2. Russell Bissell became a lieutenant of the 2d Infantry Mar. 4th, 1791; was
arranged to the 2d sub-Legion Sept. 4th, 1792; made captain Feb. 19th, 1793;
assigned to the 2d Infantry Nov. 1st, 1796; transferred to the 1st Infantry
Apr. 1st, 1802; promoted to be major of the 2d Infantry Dec. 9th, 1807, and
died Dec. 18th, 1807. Two other Connecticut Bissells who became army
officers a little later were Lieutenant Hezekiah W., who entered in 1801 and
died in 1802; and Captain Lewis, who entered as an ensign in 1808 and
resigned in 1817. One Daniel Bissell of Vermont served as a first lieutenant
for about a year, 1799-1800, and in still later years there have been several
other army officers of the same surname.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VI-6" id="Footnote_VI-6" href="#FNanchor_VI-6"><span class="label">[VI-6]</span></a> The above is such an important paragraph that I reproduce it verbatim
from the original, though it is so badly constructed as to be very obscure. The
obscurity, however, is simply bad grammar, not intentional veiling of anything;
and as the sentences cannot be conveniently reconstructed in the text, I would
read as follows:</p>

<p class="footnote">"With respect to the Ietans, the general may rest assured that I shall be
very cautious about trusting them. I feel more at a loss how to conduct myself
with the Spaniards, for my instructions send me to the Comanche country, part
of which is no doubt claimed by Spain, though the boundaries between Louisiana
and New Spain have never been settled. Consequently, should I meet a
Spanish party from the villages near Santa Fé, I think it would be good policy
to give them to understand (1) that my party was going to join our troops near
Natchitoches, but had mistaken the Rio Grande for Red river; (2) that if it
would be agreeable to the Spanish commandant, some or all of us would pay
him a polite visit; and (3) that if he did not wish us to do this, we would go
direct to Natchitoches. In any event, I flatter myself that I shall get out of the
scrape somehow. But if Spanish jealousy of Americans, and the Aaron Burr
conspiracy, cause us to be made prisoners of war (in time of peace), I trust that
you will see that we are released, and they are punished for the insult. Moreover,
if I do not feel assured they will treat us well in Mexico, I will fight
them, no matter how many there are, before I will let them take us there."</p>

<p class="footnote">This sort of talk is not that mixture of youthful enthusiasm with prudence
for which Pike begs Wilkinson's pardon in the next paragraph; but the determination
of a resolute young fellow to obey orders to the best of his ability, and
accomplish if possible the purpose of the secret instructions given him by General
Wilkinson. It is also what boys call a "dead give away"; for here, at the
outset of his Expedition, Pike is talking about going to New Mexico, intending
to deceive the Spaniards he expected to meet there, and weighing the chances
of their good or bad treatment of himself and party. I forbear to characterize
the ethics of the situation; the discerning reader will be able to look through
this hole in a grindstone, and form his own conclusions: see also <a href="#Footnote_III-46">note<sup>46</sup> p. 504</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VI-9" id="Footnote_VI-9" href="#FNanchor_VI-9"><span class="label">[VI-9]</span></a> An itemized account of the Congressional appropriation for, and estimated
expenses of, Lewis and Clark's Expedition, is given on p. xxi of the 1893 ed.
of L. and C. So far as I have been able to inform myself, we lack the data
which would enable us to make the comparison which Pike modestly conceives
might be favorable to his own expeditions. To whatever sum may have been
expended on the part of the United States for the Mississippian voyage and the
Arkansaw journey, as performed under the orders of General Wilkinson, is to be
added the cost of the enforced Mexican tour, in so far as this was paid by the
United States on the strength of claims for reimbursement presented by the
Spanish authorities. On this latter score I have found some curious unpublished
documents in the archives of the War Department at Washington. Certain of
these items will be found <a href="#Footnote_VP-2">beyond</a> in proper connection with the official correspondence
on the subject.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VI-10" id="Footnote_VI-10" href="#FNanchor_VI-10"><span class="label">[VI-10]</span></a> Pike's expected promotion to a captaincy occurred Aug. 12th, 1806.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-1" id="Footnote_IP-1" href="#FNanchor_IP-1"><span class="label">[I'-1]</span></a> The Mexican Tour trips at the start with misstatements which must have
puzzled many a reader, as they did the present editor. Reference to <a href="#Page_510">p. 510</a> will
show that yesterday, Feb. 26th, Pike "went up the river about 12 miles." He
does not say <i>what</i> river; but as he was on the Conejos, we naturally take that
to be the one he ascended that day&mdash;and we are right. But to-day he speaks of
"ascending the Rio del Norte five miles <i>more</i>," implying that yesterday's march
was up this river, as to-day's is said to be. Then we are confronted by the
statement that to-day's course is "S. 60° W."&mdash;a direction in which it is
impossible to ascend the Rio del Norte to any distance. The difficulty vanishes
at once, if for "Rio del Norte" we read <i>Rio Conejos</i>. This emendation is confirmed
by Pike's map, which contradicts the above text, showing no détour up
the Rio Grande; the dotted trail goes from the stockade directly up Rio Conejos,
to a point on its N. or left bank marked "1st. Camp"&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the "place
of deposit" to which the Spaniards took him on the 26th. This place, where
the Spaniards had established themselves when they sent for Pike, was on the
direct road by which they had come from Santa Fé, and not far from the
present town of Conejos, though probably somewhat further down the river
of that name. The road which now crosses the river at the town holds the
course of a trail which ran N. to the Saguache mts. and through Cochetope
Pass to the Gunnison and Grand rivers, and so on. This was formerly much
used by the Utes en route to Santa Fé, and was no doubt in existence in 1807.
Conejos, seat of the county so named, is a very well-known place on the river,
in the plain between the San Luis hills on the E. and the foothills of the San
Juan range on the W.; it is directly under Prospect Peak (9,900 feet; air-line
8 m.). Roads concenter here from various directions; that hence to Fort Garland,
35¼ m. N. E., crosses the place where Pike had his stockade; that S. W.
to old Fort Lowell is 49½ m. Some small places in the vicinity of Conejos are
called Guadalupe, Servilleta, San Rafael, San José, and Brazos. The route
pursued hence is the old main road S. down the Rio Grande, but at a considerable
distance W. of that river for the present (along long. 106° W. nearly).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-2" id="Footnote_IP-2" href="#FNanchor_IP-2"><span class="label">[I'-2]</span></a> Soon after leaving Conejos the party crossed Rio San Antonio, or San
Antonio cr. (the main branch of Rio Conejos), below the confluence of Los
Pinos cr., past places of both these names, and at lat. 37° N. went from the
present State of Colorado into the present Territory of New Mexico. This river
heads E. of the Tierra Amarilla, in the mountain range of which Brazos Peak,
over 11,000 feet, is a conspicuous elevation. The most notable feature of the
day is Cerro San Antonio, nearly 11,000 feet high, standing out from the range.
They skirted its E. base, among the hills of which Pike speaks, between it and
the Buffalo buttes, as the D. and R. G. R. R. now does, and where is the station
Volcano. S. W. of the peak are the Ortiz hills. Camp was set at or near the
present station Tres Piedras (Three Rocks).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-3" id="Footnote_IP-3" href="#FNanchor_IP-3"><span class="label">[I'-3]</span></a> Or Rio Caliente, as the name of the stream is now usually rendered. This
is formed by various tributaries from the N. and N. W. (Rita Servilleta, Vallecita,
etc.), and joins the Rio Chama from the W., about 5 m. above their
common entrance into the Rio Grande opp. San Juan. There are various other
hot or warm springs than the one at which Pike stopped, and this one is 10 m.
or so W. of the railroad station called Ojo Caliente. At various points near the
Rio Grande, at a considerable distance to Pike's left, are numerous isolated elevations,
some of which are Cerros Olla, Chifle, Montoso, Cristobal, Taoses, and
Orejas. Since Pike entered New Mexico, on crossing lat. 37° on the 28th, his
route has been practically along the W. border of Taos Co., so named from the
well-known Tañoan pueblo or town of Taos, frequently mentioned by him as
Tons, Tous, Toas, etc., as his printer happened to fancy, while his engraver
made it "Yaos" on the map of New Spain. This is on a branch of Taos cr.;
when Pike passes its latitude to-day, he is about 20 m. W. of it. Some places
passed along Caliente cr., to his right, are Petaca, Servilleta, and Cueva
Springs. The name Taos has several different implications: for a river, Rio de
Taos; for the country through which this river flows; for a town at the junction
of its principal forks, otherwise San Fernandez; for a place 3 m. S. E. of
this, Rancho de Taos; and for another place about the same distance N. E.,
Pueblo de Taos. San Fernandez de Taos was a Mexican adobe town, which
had some 600-800 pop. in 1846, and was the capital of the Department of
Taos. The old Indian pueblo of Taos, to which the insurgents had retreated
Jan. 7th, 1847, after the skirmishes of Cañada and Embuda, became noted during
the war as the scene of a bloody siege and capture: see Ex. Doc. No. 41,
30th Cong., 1st Sess., pub. 1848, p. 457.</p>

<p class="footnote">In approaching the subject of the New Mexican Pueblo Indians it is necessary
at the outset to free the mind from the traditional error that because these live
in towns known as "pueblos," therefore they are one kind of Indians. I shall
recur to the subject in a later connection. Here I wish to cite an early instance
of the recognition of an all-important ethnological fact on the part of Lieutenant
James H. Simpson, U. S. T. E., whose interesting Journal of a Military Reconnaissance
from Santa Fé, New Mexico, to the Navajo country, etc., in 1849,
was published in 1850 as one of the collection of papers forming Ex. Doc.
No. 64, 31st Congr., 1st Sess., 8vo, Washington, pp. 56-168, many pll. and
maps. He speaks on p. 57 of "the singular and, as I believe, the hitherto
unknown fact ... that among the 10,000 (estimated) Pueblo Indians who
inhabit New Mexico, as many as <i>six</i> distinct dialects obtain, no one showing
anything more than the faintest, if any, indications of a cognate origin with the
other." He sharply but justly brings to book the English author Ruxton, for
the grossly erroneous statement (Mex. and the R. Mts., p. 194) that "the
Indians of northern Mexico, including the Pueblos, belong to the same family&mdash;the
Apache.... All these speak dialects of the same language, more or less
approximating to the Apache, and of all of which the idiomatic structure is the
the same." A statement more at variance from the facts in the case could
hardly be penned. Those Pueblo Indians whom Pike now or presently meets
represent two distinct linguistic families, the Keresan and the Tañoan; and we
shall have several others to note in due course. The influence of the church
upon the pueblo system has of course not escaped well-informed ethnographers,
but I suspect they have not always given it full credit for the hand it had in first
founding, then maintaining in misery, and finally fetching to grief, some of these
sorry settlements of inoffensive Indians, who had escaped the Apaches on one
side and the Navajos on the other, to be herded about some mud joss-house and
fleeced as fast as they acquired any substance worth stealing. The business
began early, and the way of it is something of a historical curiosity. A man
named Alessandro Farnese&mdash;the one who was pope 1534-49, and who undertook
to regulate the morals of various persons, besides Henry VIII., with indifferent
success&mdash;once made a discovery so astonishing that he must have been inspired.
Papa Paulo III. promptly published his find in a bull which was only saved
from being Irish by the fact that it was Latin: for this ethnological pronunciamento
a todos los fieles cristianos, que las presentes letras vieren declared in
due and solemn form que los indios son hombres y capaces de sacramentos&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
told all the faithful to whom this exquisite tomfoolery came that Indians were
human and could be humbugged. That was June 9th, 1537, and that settled it&mdash;the
hint was enough to set upon the savages the horde of corrupt, profligate,
and extortionate ecclesiastics who have cursed the country from that day to this.
The first business of these people was always to build a church in which to
brandish the crucifix at those who had escaped the tomahawk, and pray for the
souls of those whose superstitions were thus played upon while their property
was preyed upon&mdash;for churches cannot be built and priests supported unless
somebody sweats for it. I hardly think that Indians thus huddled around a
church, in abject terror alike of their natural and their supernatural enemies,
outside and inside the pueblo, were any better off for self-defense than they
would have been had they been left to their natural resources&mdash;though many
have so fancied; for the numerical strength of such an aggregation would have
been just as effective without that edifice, and tame Indians are no match for
wild ones. The process of converting an Indian to Christianity simply mixes
his metaphors and muddles his mind, by substituting for the superstitions he
thinks he understands other mysteries which the priests themselves declare to be
incomprehensible. The advantage of this to the Indian is not easily discerned,
and some of its disadvantages are obvious. For example, the priests are
responsible for a considerable amount of fornication and f&oelig;ticide&mdash;I do not
mean so much by their personal habits as by their keeping so many of their
parishioners too poor to pay for marriages and baptisms. By the year 1680, the
papal plan and the church method had worked so well that the converted Indians
undertook to prove themselves men, capable of the very real sacrament of manhood;
for they revolted against the intolerable yoke, killed a great many of
their oppressors, and drove these ill-omened birds of prey from their repast for
a while.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-4" id="Footnote_IP-4" href="#FNanchor_IP-4"><span class="label">[I'-4]</span></a> Pike joins Rio Caliente with the Chama (Conejos in the text, by error) too
near Ojo Caliente and too far from San Juan, but the sum of his figures is about
right. Rio Caliente does not seem to be as well populated now as it was in his
day; Los Gallegos is a present place on this stream. The confluence of the
two is at the point of a butte, with the Black mesa immediately to the left or
E.; some of the present places thence to the Rio Grande are Cuchilla, Chili,
and San José, all on the W. side of Rio Chama, off his route, and not noted by
him; the site of Chama itself was on the other side, near the mouth. The
St. John's of the text, charted "S<sup>n</sup> Juan 1000," is the Tañoan pueblo San Juan,
pop. now 400. He crosses to this place on the E. side of the Rio Grande,
where there was a ford or ferry; the railroad crosses there now, at Española.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-5" id="Footnote_IP-5" href="#FNanchor_IP-5"><span class="label">[I'-5]</span></a> I have not succeeded in identifying Baptiste Lalande. One Alexis Lalande
(his × mark) appears among signers of a document executed at St. Louis, Oct.
30th, 1819; and on Sept. 16th, 1809, the same was one of a jury that convicted
John Long of murdering one George Gordon the previous June 26th;
and Alexis subsequently swore he neither spoke nor knew English. The William
Morrison of the same paragraph is easily discovered. He was the oldest one
of several brothers who came from Doylestown, Bucks Co., Pa.; had been associated
with his uncle, Guy Bryan, in business in Philada.; came to Kaskaskia
about 1785, and became prominent as a merchant there, in Cahokia, and
in St. Louis; married (1) a lady of Illinois; (2) in 1813, a daughter of General
Daniel Bissell, U. S. A.; died 1837, at Kaskaskia; was grandfather of Hon.

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-6" id="Footnote_IP-6" href="#FNanchor_IP-6"><span class="label">[I'-6]</span></a> In the orig. ed. this paragraph appears as Doc. No. 7, p. 69, of the App. to
Pt. 3, to which Pike refers the reader by a footnote. But as it is out of place
there, and also so short, I simply run it into the present and proper context.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-7" id="Footnote_IP-7" href="#FNanchor_IP-7"><span class="label">[I'-7]</span></a> The defective itinerary of Mar. 3d requires attention. We see that Pike
crossed the river to San Juan, whence he goes down the E. side to Santa Fé.
But first for the places he marks on the W. side within the distance to Santa
Fé, and which are: 1. Abicu, pop. 500; 2. Cia, pop. 450; and 3. Gomez, pop.
500. 1. Abicu is marked as if it stood near the mouth of Rio Chama, in the
vicinity of present San Antonio and San José; but its exact location is not difficult
to discover. For this is the town now called Abiquiu, 20 m. by the road
up the Rio Chama from the Rio Grande, on the S. side of the Chama, at the
mouth of Frijoles (Beans) cr. It is on the long and well-known trail which led
up the valley of the Chama and so on over the mountains en route to Los
Angeles, Cal. 2. Cia or Sia is a Keresan pueblo, with a present pop. of about
100. 3. Gomez is the Tañoan pueblo Jemez, misplaced too near the Rio Grande:
see note beyond for this and for Cia. The Jemez trail from San Ildefonso
passes the ruins of an old pueblo (called by the Spanish equivalent Pueblo
Viejo), on the edge of the mesa, say 1½ m. W. of the Rio Grande and 5 m.
S. W. of San Ildefonso. There is also within this distance the Tañoan pueblo
of Santa Clara, with a present pop. of over 200, on the W. side of the Rio
Grande, a mile below the mouth of Santa Clara cr. From San Juan to Santa
Fé there are or were two roads; a lower, which hugs the Rio Grande for some
distance before it turns away from the river, and an upper, more direct course,
probably that which Pike took. In either case, he crossed the two small
streams or arroyos now known as Cañada and Nambe. Along his route he
passed three villages, which are marked on the map and mentioned without
name in the text. 1. The first of these, Santa Cruz, 5 or 6 m. from San Juan,
is marked on the map "Village 1200"; in 1846 it had only 300 or 400. It is
situated on the Cañada near its mouth; higher up on the same are the Chimayo
settlements and Potrero. 2. The next, 7¼ m. further, mapped as "Village
600," is Pojoaque or Pojuaque, a Tañoan pueblo situated about 6 m. up Nambe
cr. At the mouth of this stream stood and stands another Tañoan pueblo, San
Ildefonso; while Nambe, yet another village of the same family, was located
on the same creek about 3 m. above Pojoaque. These have all declined during
the century, the Indian pop. of Pojoaque being lately given as 20, that of San
Ildefonso 148, that of Nambe 79. 3. The next village, "17 m." further, marked
on the map "Village 600," is Tesuque (Tesugue, Zesuqua, etc.), likewise a
Tañoan pueblo, now of less than 100 Indians. There appear to have been two
establishments of this name, 3 or 4 m. apart, both on a branch of Nambe cr.;
the furthest on, falling in best with Pike's 17 m. from Pojoaque, is only some
6 m. from Santa Fé. Between Pojoaque and Tesuque Pike passed by
Cuyamanque or Cuyamunge: and he entered Santa Fé from the N., by the
site of old Fort Marcy.</p>

<p class="footnote">It should be particularly observed in this place that Pike has <i>two</i> maps of this
part of the Rio Grande, which are discrepant in several material respects. One
is his <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43776/43776-h/43776-h.htm#i-108">Louisiana map</a>, which he runs down to take in the Rio Grande to Santa
Fé. On this his trail is dotted as if it were the lower one, hugging the Rio
Grande from Santa Cruz past Santa Clara (and Polvaredo) to San Ildefonso,
before it turned off to Santa Fé, and with the above three villages all on his
left as he passed; the above village of Abicu is lettered Abricu, and a certain
village of "Pino" is set at the mouth of Rio Santa Fé. I have here gone by
his <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43776/43776-h/43776-h.htm#i-109">New Spain map</a>, which may be presumed to be his best delineation of
Rio Grande country, and which certainly fits in best with the text which we
here follow.</p>

<p class="footnote">To finish reckoning the towns Pike maps north of Santa Fé, we must note
the following: 1. "Enbudo 500" on both maps. 2. "Tranpa 450" on one
map, and "Tramha 450" on the other. 3. "Pecucio 500" on one map, and
"Pecucis 500" on the other. These places all lie off to the N. E., in the
direction of Taos. 1. Embudo or Embuda is a town on a creek of the same
name, which makes into the Rio Grande from the E., about 25 m. by the road
from San Juan. The location is a couple of miles above the mouth of the creek,
which falls into the Rio Grande at a place called Rinconada on account of its
cornered or shut-in site among the surrounding mesas. It is near the scene of
an engagement in Jan., 1847, when Captain John H. K. Burgwin of the 1st
U. S. Dragoons defeated the insurgents; he died Feb. 7th of wounds received
Feb. 4th in the assault on Taos. 2. Trampas is a town on the creek of that
name, a main tributary of the Embudo, 8 or 10 m. above the town of Embudo.
You pass Trampas about halfway on the main upper road from Santa Fé
to Taos, about 7 m. N. of Truchas. 3. Picuris is an old Tañoan pueblo, on
another branch of this same Embudo cr., with a present pop. of 100.</p>

<p class="footnote">All the foregoing places are under the shadow of the lofty mountains to the
E., whence the several streams named also make down into the Rio Grande
valley. Some of their peaks are: Lake, 12,400 feet; Baldy, 12,600 feet; the
Cone, 12,700 feet; Truches, 13,100 feet; and the more isolated "U. S."
mountain, 10,700 feet. On the other side of this range are the headwaters of Rio
Cañada&mdash;that great fork of the Arkansaw better known as the "Canadian" r.,
without the <i>tilde</i>: see <a href="#Footnote_V-17">note<sup>17</sup>, p. 558</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-8" id="Footnote_IP-8" href="#FNanchor_IP-8"><span class="label">[I'-8]</span></a> Santa Fé is not "on the Rio Grande," as often loosely said, but at least
20 m. (direct) E. of that river, and considerably further than this up from the
mouth of the small stream on which it is situated, in a rather out-of-the-way
place. This creek, Rio de Santa Fé, or Rio Chacito, comes down from the
lofty Santa Fé mts. under which the town nestles, and runs with a general
S. W. course into the Rio Grande between the town of Peña Blanca and the old
pueblo of Cochiti&mdash;places 3 m. apart. Cochiti is a Keresan pueblo on the W.
bank of the Rio Grande; present pop. perhaps 250. Peña Blanca, often called
Piña Blanca, on the E. bank, is a place where the Rio Grande can be forded,
to take the old road from Santa Fé to Fort Wingate.</p>

<p class="footnote">Santa Fé was first entered and occupied by the Army of the West under
General Stephen Watts Kearny, Aug. 18th, 1846&mdash;his cowardly Excellency
Don Manuel Armijo having blustered and promptly evacuated the place on the
approach of our forces. The site of Fort Marcy was selected by Lieutenants
W. H. Emory and J. F. Gilmer, in a commanding position 600 yards from the
plaza of the town, and the work began on the 23d. On Sept. 22d General
Kearny issued his manifesto for the government of New Mexico, under the
authority of the President of the United States; appointing as governor Charles
Bent (soon afterward cruelly massacred at Taos), and as secretary Donaciano
Vigil; other territorial officers appointed were Richard Dallum, Francis P.
Blair, Charles Blummer, Eugene Lertensdorfer, Joab Houghton, Antonio José
Otero, and Carl Bavbien&mdash;the last three as judges of the supreme court. A copy
of the original document, in Spanish, is given in Lieutenant J. W. Abert's report
Ex. Doc. No. 41, 30th Cong., 1st Sess., pub. 1848, p. 453. The population of
Santa Fé at that time was somewhere about 3,000; it is now only a little over
6,000. It was probably the site of a pueblo before 1500; but the present town
has no authentic history back of 1608, when it was founded by Juan de Oñate
as a capital or seat of government. The town may boast an unbroken record
as such from that day to this, in spite of changing hands several times.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-9" id="Footnote_IP-9" href="#FNanchor_IP-9"><span class="label">[I'-9]</span></a> Lieutenant J. W. Abert supposes that these were those long known as the
parroquia or parish church, and the capilla de los soldados or military chapel:
Ex. Doc. No. 41, 30th Cong., 1st Sess., pub. 1848, p. 454, where an account
of them and services held in them, as these were in 1846, may be read. A plate
shows the parish church, with "Fort Marez" (Marcy) in the distance.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-10" id="Footnote_IP-10" href="#FNanchor_IP-10"><span class="label">[I'-10]</span></a> The governor's certificate and Pike's remonstrance, here in mention, were
given in the App. to Pt. 3, of which they formed Docs. <a href="#orig9-b">Nos. 9</a> and <a href="#orig8-b">8</a>, and will
be found in due course, beyond.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-11" id="Footnote_IP-11" href="#FNanchor_IP-11"><span class="label">[I'-11]</span></a> Pike has the thing all right, but under a curious name I never saw elsewhere,
and might not have recognized, had I not happened to hear <i>cojinillo</i>
myself in New Mexico. This word is probably provincial or dialectal, as it is
not found in ordinary Sp. dictionaries; in form it is a diminutive of <i>cojin</i>, name
of a certain saddle-pad or cushion, precisely equivalent to E. "pillion." It
turns up now and then in books about Mexico, as for example: "The <i>corazas</i>
[covers] of travelling saddles are also provided with several pockets called
<i>coginillos</i>&mdash;a most excellent contrivance for carrying a lunch or a bottle, or anything
to which convenient access may be desired," Gregg, Comm. Pra., I. 1844,
p. 214.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-12" id="Footnote_IP-12" href="#FNanchor_IP-12"><span class="label">[I'-12]</span></a> Marked "Vitior 200" on Pike's map. I do not recognize this name, but
it is easy to pick out Pike's road to San Domingo, which he reaches to-morrow,
and locate his Vitior at or within a mile of a place on the Rio Santa Fé now
called La Bajada, which is 7¾ m. from San Domingo. In starting from
Santa Fé for the Rio Grande at this point, you do not follow down the creek
(Rio de Santa Fé or Rio Chacito), but bear away from it on higher ground between
it and Arroyo Hondo, pass a little place called Agua Fria, and then
have a choice of two roads. One of these bears off more to the left, and
strikes the creek at the hamlet of Cieneguilla, whence you follow the creek in
the cañon to La Bajada; but the straighter road keeps on S. W., crosses the
creek higher up, cuts across the mesa south of Tetilla Peak, and suddenly
pitches down into the creek at the mouth of the cañon, where La Bajada is situated.
This is what I suppose Pike means by saying he ascended a hill and
then descended a precipice. If he went that way, he rode 15 m. from Santa
Fé to "Vitior" or La Bajada. (See <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43776/43776-h/43776-h.htm#Vitior">Vitior</a> in Index.)</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-13" id="Footnote_IP-13" href="#FNanchor_IP-13"><span class="label">[I'-13]</span></a> Present Santo Domingo, or San Domingo, is at the mouth of Galisteo cr.,
with the pueblo immediately below it, on the E. bank of the Rio Grande, 4 or
5 m. below Peña Blanca. Pike charts it by name, and lays down this creek.
The plate opp. p. 462 of Lieutenant Abert's report shows the pueblo as it was
in 1846. Part of the road from Santa Fé to San Domingo was bad, on account
of the rocks in the cañon of the little stream, and the sandy dunes near the
pueblo. On getting out of the cañon onto the plain, Pike had on his left the
Sandia range, while ahead, but somewhat to the right, rose the Jemez mts.
The Galisteo was probably quite dry. There were no trees to be seen till the
cottonwood fringe of the Rio Grande came into view. The pueblo did not vary
much for a century. It had about 800 pop. when I passed through in 1864;
a very recent census yielded 690. As Pike says, these Indians are "of the
nation of Keres," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, of the Keresan family. Had he taken the ford across
the Rio Grande, which was used here at times when the water was not more than
three or four feet deep, though 300 yards wide, and gone westward about 26 m.
to the Rio Jemez, he would have come upon the Tañoan town of Jemez, a dead-alive
little place, which has held its population of 400 or 500 for many generations,
and long sustained its old adobe church. Twelve miles above Jemez, at
a place on the river called Ojos Calientes from its hot springs, were and may still
be seen the ruins of another church, a view of which, as they appeared in 1849,
is given on pl. 15 of Simpson's report already cited. Jemez is the place Pike
means by the "Gomez 300" which he charts; only it is located too near the
Rio Grande on his map. (See <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43776/43776-h/43776-h.htm#Santo_Domingo_N_M">Santo Domingo</a> in Index.)</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-14" id="Footnote_IP-14" href="#FNanchor_IP-14"><span class="label">[I'-14]</span></a> Marked "S<sup>n</sup>. Philip de queres 1000" on the map, on the W. side of the
Rio Grande. This is the pueblo of San Felipe, situated 7 m. S. of San Domingo,
opp. the mouth of Tuerto cr., which falls in from the E., a little below the gulch
or ravine called Arroyo del Espinazo. The town of Covero, or Cubero, is 5 m.
above, on the same (W.) side of the Rio Grande. The large stream which
Pike lays down on that side, just below his St. Philip's, is the Rio Jemez, which
falls in between Algodones and Bernalillo. The word "queres" of the map is
the same as Keres of the above text; <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, San Felipe is a town of the Keresan
nation. The place is on the W. side of the Rio Grande, which here straitens
to 100 yards or so, about 6 m. above Algodones. Pike's town was no doubt
the <i>present</i> San Felipe&mdash;the one at the foot of the mesa, and not that commonly
called old San Felipe, about a mile off, upon the edge of the mesa; for this
was in ruins half a century if not a century ago, and the pueblos are all slow to
change, either for better or worse. It has taken nearly 100 years to reduce San
Felipe from the population which Pike estimated at 1000 to the 550 of a very
recent census. It has been more Mexicanized than some of the other Indian
towns. Lieutenant Abert, speaking of the bridge which Pike mentions, says
that when he was there, Oct. 10th, 1846, it had been entirely swept away, and
the people had to ford the Rio Grande. The plate opp. p. 461 of his report
shows some of them in the act. Another view of San Felipe is given in the
same volume, opp. p. 39, in the report of Lieutenant W. H. Emory, who says
that "the hardships, trials, and perseverance of the gallant Pike" came forcibly
to his mind when he first caught sight of the Rio Grande, Sept. 2d, 1846, at
San Domingo, whose population he judged to be about 600.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-15" id="Footnote_IP-15" href="#FNanchor_IP-15"><span class="label">[I'-15]</span></a> Marked "S Dies 500" on the map, on the E. side of the Rio Grande, to
which Pike recrossed from San Felipe. The Spanish form would be San Diaz,
but the pueblo is best known as Sandia or Zandia, a name also applied to the
great mountain which rises on the E. As a Spanish word, <i>sandia</i> means
"watermelon," and appeared in print as the name of this village in 1626. The
aboriginal name of the pueblo is Nafiap, and its mission name was Nuestra Señora
de los Dolores de Sandia. This is a Tañoan town, with a present population of
about 150. The situation is 12 m. above Albuquerque. Pike speaks of two
small hamlets he passed to reach St. Dies. In 1864, when I passed over the road,
there was a mean place called Algodones, of 30 or 40 houses and some 200 or
300 people, and 6 m. below this was a rather better one named Bernalillo. This
is doubtless what Pike charts as "S Bernilla 500." Bernalillo is present
name of a station of the A., T., and S. F. R. R. Simpson relates that when he
passed Sandia in 1849 he noticed in the space of a mile northward from the
pueblo some 60 or 70 piles of stones which were said to mark the places where
as many Navajos had fallen in battle with the Pueblonians some years before.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-16" id="Footnote_IP-16" href="#FNanchor_IP-16"><span class="label">[I'-16]</span></a> Old Albuquerque, to be distinguished from the present contiguous or adjacent
city of the same name, one of the best-known places on the Rio Grande
between Santa Fé and El Paso. In coming to this town Pike passed sites of
several places now named, though none of any note&mdash;as Corrales (on the opposite
or W. side of the river, whence there is a road 18&#8532; m. to pueblo of
Cebolleta); Alameda (where the river could be crossed to strike the Corrales-Cebolleta
road); Ranchos d'Albuquerque; Los Griegos; and finally Candelaria.
The word Albuquerque, or more properly Alboquerque, is the same as the
name of the very celebrated Portuguese son of Mars and soldier of fortune,
Affonso d'Alboquerque, who flourished in the latter part of the fifteenth century
and early in the sixteenth (b. 1453, d. Dec. 16th, 1515). It is commonly pronounced
on the spot Albykirky, and sometimes Albykirk. The old town was
in existence about 1700, and now has some 1,750 pop.; the new one is a thing
of yesterday, so to speak, but already a notable railroad center, capital of Bernalillo
Co., with nearly 4,000 pop., and scheduled as 58 m. from Santa Fé. Near
Albuquerque there was a ford to a place called Atrisco, whence the road led westward
to Fort Wingate; while eastward from Albuquerque a road went to the
Tijeras cañon, which marks off the Sandia range proper from the elevation S.
of this cañon called Monte Largo. Tijeras cr., when it runs, falls into the Rio
Grande about 8 m. below Albuquerque. Sandival, a place that appears on
various maps, was Sandival's hacienda, a couple of miles S. of Albuquerque, on
an upper and dryer road than the one usually taken southward.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-17" id="Footnote_IP-17" href="#FNanchor_IP-17"><span class="label">[I'-17]</span></a> No crossing of the Rio Grande is indicated on Pike's map anywhere along
here, his trail being dotted continuously on the E. side of the river. But it is
quite certain that he crossed a little below old Albuquerque to Atrisco. There
was here a ford, regularly used when the water was not too high. The railroad
now crosses some miles lower down, between Isleta station and Isleta. Atrisco
was a very well-known name, in consequence of the ford, before the days of the
railroads, but is hardly to be found on ordinary maps of to-day. When I first
crossed the Rio Grande, June 23d, 1864, our outfit was ferried over some 20 m.
below Albuquerque, between places called Los Pinos on the E. and Las Lunas
on the W. "Los Pinos" is short for Bosque or Alamo de los Pinos, as they
called the large fine grove of cottonwoods there, but I do not think there were
any pines. A couple of miles below was the hacienda of Mariano Chavez,
brother of the unfortunate A. J. Chavez who was murdered near the Little
Arkansaw: see <a href="#Footnote_II-10">note<sup>10</sup>, p. 424</a>; M. Chavez was dead himself before 1847.
The place where Pike so joyfully met the blooming Robinson is left open to
question in the present text. If by the "next village" he means the next one
he came to after leaving Albuquerque, this was certainly at or near the site of
Atrisco. This is really the implication; otherwise we should have to go a good
ways down the W. bank of the Rio Grande, to site of present Pajarito, or perhaps
Isleta, at which latter place is now the junction of the Atl. and Pac. with the A.,
T., and S. F. R. R. The doubt is cleared away by the text of the 8th, where
it appears that Pike visited Tousac (see <a href="#Footnote_IP-18">next note</a>) 3 m. from the village where
Robinson was, and on the same (W.) side of the river, where the troops had
been sent over night; and was then carted back over to the E. side of the river.
He simply visited across the Rio Grande, as he had done at San Felipe, and
then returned to continue his regular journey down the E. side. But neither of
these two cases is put very clearly at first blush in the narrative.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-18" id="Footnote_IP-18" href="#FNanchor_IP-18"><span class="label">[I'-18]</span></a> "Tousac 500" is marked nearly opposite Albuquerque, at or near present
site of Atrisco. What this can be, unless it is Atrisco itself, or some old place
close by. I do not know. The name reminds us of Tesuque (see <a href="#Footnote_IP-7">note<sup>7</sup>, p. 605</a>),
but the place here meant is obviously not that one. (See <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43776/43776-h/43776-h.htm#Tousac">Tousac</a> in Index.)</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-19" id="Footnote_IP-19" href="#FNanchor_IP-19"><span class="label">[I'-19]</span></a> "S. Fernandez 500" is marked on the map as the first village below Albuquerque
on the E. side. I do not recognize the name, nor can I find it on
any one of several maps examined. No distance being given for the 8th, I
am left entirely at a loss. But in no event can Pike have passed Peralta, a
well-known place, and he is probably not far short of it. We may therefore
note some places between Albuquerque and Peralta. Pajarito Arriba and
Pajarito Bajo (Upper and Lower Pajarito) are two towns 3 m. apart, 3 and 6 m.
below Atrisco, on the W. side of the river; and Tijeras or Tijera cr. or arroyo
comes to the river from the E. about a mile below Pajarito Bajo. Three
m. beyond this last town is Padillas, a Mexican town near the foot of the
mesa, and three beyond this is Isleta&mdash;both on the W. side. None of these
places was of importance; but Isleta is now a station on the A., T., and S. F.
R. R., which makes a crossing of the Rio Grande to it from Isleta station on
the E. side; and in the immediate vicinity of Isleta is the junction of the A.
and P. R. R. Below Isleta station, on the E., are the Ranchitos d'Isleta;
next is Los Pinos, already mentioned, then Chavez, and a mile from this stands
Peralta. The latter was known at one time as Ontero's hacienda.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-20" id="Footnote_IP-20" href="#FNanchor_IP-20"><span class="label">[I'-20]</span></a> "S. Thomas 500" on Pike's map, a mile beyond which was camp of the
9th. As 12 m. advance was made to-day, St. Thomas and St. Fernandez were
places 11 m. apart. Los Pinos, Peralta, and Valencia are all places within
3 m. of one another, and more or less nearly opposite Las Lunas, on the west,
long a notable point of crossing of the Rio Grande, and present seat of Valencia
Co. It is situated in the San Clemente tract, and near it are Las Lunas
hills. Five miles below Valencia, on the E. side of the Rio Grande, is Tomé
hill, a conspicuous butte on the edge of the mesa, in lat. 34° 45´. Tomé and
the Tomé ranches are 2 or 3 m. further south. These stretched along the
river for more than a mile, presenting at times well cultivated and well irrigated
grainfields.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-21" id="Footnote_IP-21" href="#FNanchor_IP-21"><span class="label">[I'-21]</span></a> "Sibilleta 1000," which Pike marks on his trail on the E. bank of the
Rio Grande, is otherwise Cibolleta, La Joya de Cibolleta, or old La Joya, within
the area of the Cevilleta or Joya Grant, and in Socorro Co. (next county S.
of Valencia). Present La Joya is across the river, on the W. side; the railroad
goes through it. Beyond old La Joya is Joya cañon, on the E. All these places
are a few miles S. of the confluence of the Rio Puerco with the Rio Grande,
on the W. The Puerco is a sizable stream, or dry bed of one, on a general S.
course, crossed at 23 m. distance in going W. from Las Lunas along the old
road to Zuñi, Fort Wingate, etc. Where I crossed, it was a sluggish thread of
dirty yellow water which one could bestride; but it is some 75 m. long, and
important in furnishing bounds to several of the land grants in Valencia and
Bernalillo cos. There is no trace of the Puerco on Pike's map, though he lays
down both Rio Chama and Rio Jemez. Before coming to the confluence of
the Puerco he passed a number of places now named, which may be taken up
thus: On the E. side are Constancia, Casa Colorada, Vellita, and Las Nutrias,
with several others of less note. Casa Colorada ("Red House") gives name
to the grant next south of Tomé Grant; it is on the Rio Grande, 4 m. above
the mouth of that considerable stream, high up on which are the ruins of Abo.
On the W. side, where the railroad now runs, a principal place is Belen, in the
vicinity of which were others which were called Ranchos de Belen, and Pueblitos
de Belen; nearly opposite the last, but directly on the W. bank of the
river, is Jarales. Next above the Belen pueblito, on the railroad, is Trejos,
and next below it is San José. Below the last named is a point of woods, called
in Spanish Punto del Bosque, and here is a place named Bosque. Rancho
Sabinal, Sabinal station, and a certain Pueblito succeed one another, bringing
us about opposite the above said Las Nutrias.</p>

<p class="footnote">Along this whole stretch of the Rio Grande, from Peralta nearly to La Joya,
a range of mountains extends in the E. offing, say 15-20 m. air-line to their
summits. This is the Manzano range, running N. and S.; some of its peaks, up
to 10,000 feet, are called Mosca, Capilla, Osha, and Manzano. The range continues
S. under the name of Cerro Montoso. Roads start from many places
on the Rio Grande to go through the cañons or passes in these mountains.</p>

<p class="footnote">We have also to attend to Sabinez and Xaxales of the above text, and with
these may note several other pueblos Pike charts in this region.</p>

<p class="footnote">1. Sabinez, or Sabinal, or Savinal, was a place near the W. bank of the
Rio Grande, in the vicinity of present Sabinal station on the railroad, about 10
m. above new La Joya, and somewhat less above the mouth of Rio Puerco.</p>

<p class="footnote">2. "Xaxales 300" is marked a few miles S. of Sabinez, at or near the place
on the railroad now called Pueblito, 6 or 8 m. above new La Joya. "Xaxales"
is the same word as Jarales (otherwise Gerrales), but does not seem to have
denoted the place now called by the latter name.</p>

<p class="footnote">3. Next W. of Sabinez and Xaxales, but well off the Rio Grande, Pike
marks "Seguna 250." This is the large, old, and still flourishing Keresan
pueblo of Laguna, with a present pop. of over 1,100. It is so called from the
little lake or laguna hard by, on a branch of the Rito San José (a branch of the
Rio Puerco). This pueblo is on the main road from the Rio Grande to Zuñi
and so on. An old Navajo trail takes or took off N. from Laguna, up another
branch of the same rito, in the course of which latter is a cluster of small
pueblos, as Povete, Pojuate, or Paguate; Moquino; Cebolleta; and Cebolletita;
there were also various ruined pueblos here and there in the region watered by
the Rito San José and its several trickling affluents. Covero is a pueblo not far
W. N. W. of Laguna.</p>

<p class="footnote">4. Pike marks "Cequimas 500" some distance S. W. of Laguna. This is
the old and well-known Keresan pueblo of Acoma, on another affluent of the
San José system, with a present pop. of about the same as it had in his time.
Plates of Acoma and various other towns illustrate Lieut. J. W. Abert's report,
Ex. Doc. 41, 30th Congr., 1st Sess., pub. 1848. (See <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43776/43776-h/43776-h.htm#Cequimas">Cequimas</a> in Index.)</p>

<p class="footnote">5. "Zumi 300" is charted near both of the foregoing, and E. of the continental
divide. This is an error of location, for the pueblo meant is that of
Zuñi or Suinyi, one of the largest and on the whole the best known of all the
Indian towns in New Mexico. It is situated on the Rio Zuñi, tributary to the
Colorado river system, and, therefore, on the Pacific slope. The place is
famous as the very heart of the region where the "Seven Cities of Cibola"
stood at the dawn of the historic period in Spanish invasion of this country;
one of the seven having furnished at least a part of the present site of Zuñi.
The Zuñian people, to the number of some 1,600, alone represent a distinct
nation of pueblonians, called the Zuñian family: see a note <a href="#Footnote_IVP-23">beyond</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote">6. West of his line of continental-divide mountains Pike locates two pueblos,
or rather Indian villages, by the names of "Cumpa" and "Chacat." These are
not far apart, and both approximate to the four Moki villages he charts: see a
note <a href="#Footnote_IVP-24">beyond</a> for the Mokis. The identification of Cumpa may be in question;
but Chacat evidently stands for what Pike learned of the old establishments in
the Cañon de Chaco, or de Chasco. This is in N. W. New Mexico, and in
such extent of the cañon as has running water is the Rio Chaco, tributary of
Rio San Juan, a branch of the Colorado Grande which enters above the mouth of
the Colorado Chiquito, in Utah. This cañon once harbored a large population
in several different establishments, all long since gone to ruins; and the Chaco
people have been the subjects of much disputed history. An excellent account
of the ruins is contained in Simpson's Report, pp. 73-86; views of some of them
are given on several plates. On his map the names of 10 of the 12 he locates
stand as Pintado, Wejegi, Una Vida, Hungo Pavi, Chetho Kette, Bonito, Del
Arroyo, Nos. 8 and 9 blank, Peñasca Blanca.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-22" id="Footnote_IP-22" href="#FNanchor_IP-22"><span class="label">[I'-22]</span></a> Past Joya cañon to the vicinity of La Joyita, near the S. border of the
Joya Grant. This is a small town near which some black basaltic bluffs reach
down close to the river. It is not to be confounded with the village of similar
name, La Joya, a few miles further on.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-23" id="Footnote_IP-23" href="#FNanchor_IP-23"><span class="label">[I'-23]</span></a> The Black mts. of Pike's text, Sierra Obscura of his map, are in the series
of ranges along the E. side of the Rio Grande, at varying but always considerable
distances. These are in general but not exact continuation of the San Diaz
or Sandia mts., and take, in different parts of their extent, other names, as Cerro
Manzano, Cerro Montoso, etc.; the name Sierra Oscura or Black range being
now restricted to a short chain between the Chupadera mesa on the N. and the
San Andreas chain on the S. Though there is of course no such linear continuity
of these ranges as Pike's Sierra Obscura seems to represent, yet I think
Pike hit off the mountains wonderfully well, considering the stealthy circumstances
under which he observed them. All through "the captivity" in New
Spain he had to make his notes furtively, and then conceal them&mdash;in other
words, he stole and hid away his information. His Sierra Obscura is all the
better delineated by his marking certain southern portions of the chain with the
names "Sierra de el Sacramento" and "Sierra de Guadelupe"&mdash;these being
ranges which he was never near, if in fact he ever laid eyes on them. They
are those called to-day the Sacramento and Guadalupe ranges, trending S. E.
toward the Rio Pecos, down to lat. 32° or thereabouts; they are special southward
extensions of the huge nest of mountains which bound for a great distance
the water-shed of the Pecos, and are broken into many lesser ranges and peaks,
as the White range (Sierra Blanca), the Nogal, Capitan, Carrizo, Jicarilla, etc.
In perhaps no point is Pike's (qu: Humboldt's?) map clearer than where he runs
his "Montagnes de Salines" N. between his Sierra Obscura on the E. and the
Rio Grande on the W.; for this is the San Andreas range, which extends continuously
southward from the Sierra Oscura of present geography, and whose
southern portions now bear the names of the Organ and Franklin mts., ending
only near El Paso. The Organ mts. were better and have been long known by
the Spanish name of Sierra de los Organos, exactly as lettered by Pike. This
curious name originated in the fancied resemblance of the columnar trap formations
to the pipes of an organ. Wislizenus and Hughes both call them the
"Organic" mts. Their fastnesses were favorite and habitual lurking-places of
the Mescalero Apaches&mdash;those murderous freebooters and desperadoes who used
to descend upon the peaceful pueblos and the Spanish settlements. "The
Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold," and so did the Apache, not
only from the Organ mts. and other parts of the San Andreas or Salinas range,
but also from all the mountains above mentioned as lying further east. Observe
that Pike thrice locates Apaches among these mountains, lettering "Apaches
Faraone," "Apaches Mescaleros," and "Apaches Mescalorez." He also locates
what he calls "Indiens Ietans"; these are the Comanches, usually given in his
text as "Tetaus," who played the part of Vandals to the Goths of the Apaches&mdash;twin
scourges during the whole historic period and down to our own day, under
the leadership of chiefs whose characters recall the popular impressions of
Attila the Hun. The only serious criticism to be passed on this part of Pike's
map is the way he runs a great river in the country of his Ietans and Mescaleros,
between his Sierra Obscura and his Montagnes de Salines, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, in the
deserts E. of his San Andreas range and W. of the other mountains. But this
is simply his misapprehension of such information as he had of the course of
the Pecos; for his "Rio Puerto" is a mistake for Rio Puerco, and this was a
long current though mistaken name of the Pecos, to be found on various maps
and in different itineraries of comparatively recent dates. It is hardly necessary
to add that the Pecos lies eastward of all the mountains now under consideration;
there is no such river where Pike lays down his "Rio Puerto." That
region is a horrid desert, where such waters as may start from the mountains on
either hand soon run out by evaporation and absorption, or lose themselves
in those salty sinks and alkaline wastes whence originated, in fact, the former
name of "Saline" or "Salinas" mts. for the San Andreas range.</p>

<p class="footnote">As to the "Mountains of Magdalen" of Pike's text: We observe that he
maps two isolated elevations on his right, W. of the Rio Grande, respectively
lettered "Sierra Magillez" and "Sierra Christopher." These clearly correspond
to two of the most conspicuous elevations, Mt. Magdalen and Old Baldy,
of the range which continues to be known as that of the Magdalen mts. or Sierra
Magdalena. These are a short but high range directly W. of the county town
Socorro, whence a branch of the railroad now runs into them to the place
called Magdalena. This range rises 20 m. and more from the river; in this
interval a series of lesser elevations stretches northward, taking at successive
points the names of Socorro, Limitar, Polvadero, and Ladron&mdash;the two last of
these being separated by the arroyo of the Rio Salado, coming to the Rio
Grande from the W. in the vicinity of the Joya cañon from the E.</p>

<p class="footnote">The position of Pike's camp of the 12th is not easily determined, as he gives
no mileage and names no place. But it was not far below Socorro, and perhaps
in the close vicinity of Bosquecito. His <i>Sierra</i> Christopher (W. of the river)
is to be carefully distinguished from what he further on calls the "mountain of
the Friar Christopher," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, Fra Cristobal, on the E. of the river: see <a href="#Footnote_IP-25">note<sup>25</sup>,
pp. 635, 636</a>, and <a href="#Footnote_IP-30">note<sup>30</sup>, p. 639</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote">When Pike passed a couple of miles below Parida, on the E. side of the Rio
Grande, he had to climb a steep hill close to the river. From the top of this
there is a fine view to be had of various places. Nearly opposite is Socorro, on
the W. bank; Limitar is visible, 6 or 8 m. higher up on that side; while about
4 m. below is the site of the ruins of Las Huertas (the Orchards). Socorro was
long one of the largest and most important places on the Rio Grande. It had
a population of 2,000 about the middle of this century.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-24" id="Footnote_IP-24" href="#FNanchor_IP-24"><span class="label">[I'-24]</span></a> No mileage for to-day, nor even number of hours on the march; no named
point. In fact Pike's itinerary from Santa Fé thus far hardly gives a natural
feature&mdash;not even the mouth of the Rio Puerco; we have to check it as best
we can by a few names of towns now nearly a century old, and not always
indicating a present location, together with what we may suppose to have been
ordinary days' journeys. Camp of the 13th may be set somewhere within the
limits of the present Bosque del Apache Grant, a good ways below Bosquecitos
and San Pedro on the E., or San José and San Antonio on the W. A view of
the Bosque faces p. 499 of Abert's report. The grant named is a small triangular
area whose N. base is the S. border of the Socorro Grant, whose W. side
adjoins the E. border of the Armendaris Grant, and whose apex is at or near
Mt. Pascal (Cerro San Pascual). Old Fort Conrad was built on the W. side of
the river, nearly opposite but a little above Valverde. Valverde was inhabited
during the first quarter of this century, but the inhabitants were killed
or driven off by the Apaches and Navajos, and it showed nothing but its ruins
in 1846, as delineated on the plate of Abert's report, facing p. 506. Writing
of 1839, Gregg says, Comm. Pra. II. 1844, p. 71: "We passed the southernmost
settlements of New Mexico, and 20 or 30 miles further down the river we
came to the ruins of Valverde. This village was founded about 20 years ago,
in one of the most fertile valleys of the Rio del Norte. It increased rapidly in
population, until it was invaded by the Navajoes, when the inhabitants were
obliged to abandon the place after considerable loss, and it has never since been
repeopled." This locality, in a narrow, sandy valley, some 15 m. by the road
above Fra Cristobal mt., used to be a point of departure in various directions
from the Rio Grande, and the name occurs continually in the history of scouts
on reconnoissances in this region before our Civil War; it was the general
rendezvous of Doniphan's forces, preparatory to his invasion of Mexico and
capture of Chihuahua; and it was the scene of a battle, for gallant and meritorious
services in which action a particular friend of mine, Allen Latham
Anderson, was brevetted major, Feb. 21st, 1862.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-25" id="Footnote_IP-25" href="#FNanchor_IP-25"><span class="label">[I'-25]</span></a> To-day's itinerary brings up a number of interesting and important
points, not evident at first sight. Below Valverde and San Pascual mt. Pike
comes to a section of the river which has made much history. Along
here, above and below Valverde, within a very few miles of one another, are
the sites of Fort Conrad and old Fort Craig, both on the W. bank of the
river; the position of the present places known as Arny, San Marcia, and
Plaza Grande on the W., with La Mesa and Contadero on the E.; the
present crossing of the railroad to the Mesa Prieta, from points higher
up on the W.; and below this the Rio Grande crossing known as Paraje
ferry, near the place of that name on the E. But we are mainly concerned to
discover Pike's "point from which the road leaves the river"; and why at
this point his escort should have abandoned the main road due S., two
days' journey, to take him across the river and then S. W., by a rough and
roundabout way for several days till, bearing S. E., the route should strike
the S. end of the direct road which had been left at its N. end. If we should
imagine some dark Spanish mystery here, we should be mistaken; for Malgares
simply took Pike that way to avoid the terrible Jornada del Muerto&mdash;that
Macabresque march which too often proved to be literally a "journey of
the dead." It is now, as it was then, the great highway directly N. and
S.; but what is now bowled over at ease in a few hours by rail, was then
the toilsome, perilous, and sometimes fatal journey through an awful desert.
When I was in New Mexico, 30 years ago, officers and others who had made
this jornada were never weary of descanting upon the terrors of that "ninety
miles without, a drop of water," as it was commonly said to be. The trip is
not quite so far as this, between the points where the river is usually left
and regained; but it is not much less, and lives often hung upon the uncertainty
whether any water could be found at a midway point known as Laguna
del Muerto, or Lake of the Dead. The route of the Jornada is like the string
of a bow whose arc is the Rio Grande, stretched straight up and down the
desert between the river on the W. and the San Andreas range on the E., or
rather between this range and those mountains on the W. of itself which close
in on the E. bank of the river, cause its deflection, and render travel along its
left (E.) bank difficult or impossible. Hence the crossing of the river at a
point above them, to go along the right or W. bank, as Malgares did, was the
alternative to the Jornada del Muerto. The mountains in mention are a
barren range which begins to hug the river in the vicinity of Paraje, below
Contadero, and is known as the Fra Cristobal range; this, or rather the northern
end of it, is the "mountain of the Friar Christopher," of which Pike speaks.
The chain continues southward (with only partial interruption, in the vicinity
of Fort McRae), as the Sierra de los Caballos, or Horse range. Pike lays
down ranges at three separate points, lettered "Las Pennuclas" (for Los
Penáculos, the Pinnacles), "Horse M<sup>n.</sup>" and "Death M<sup>n.</sup>"; the first of these
being an elevation of the Cristobal range, probably that now called Cristobal
Peak, and the second and third being parts of the Caballos range. Whatever
the exact point at which the main road left the river when Pike passed, it was
near if not at the same point whence the Jornada has begun for half a century
at least, and which took the name Fra Cristobal from the mountain. Thus, we
read in Gregg, Comm. Pra. II. 1844, pp. 71-72: "Our next camping place
deserving of mention was <i>Fray Cristóbal</i>, which, like many others on the
route, is neither town nor village, but a simple isolated point on the river-bank&mdash;a
mere <i>parage</i>, or camping-ground ... thus being the threshold of the
famous <i>Jornada del Muerto</i>." The words of Dr. Wislizenus on this subject are
to precisely the same effect, Mem., 1848, p. 38: "This camping place is
known as <i>Fray Cristobal</i>; but as there is neither house nor settlement here, and
one may fix his camp close on or some distance from the river, the limits of
Fray Cristobal are not so distinctly defined as those of a city, and generally the
last camping place on or near the Rio del Norte before entering the <i>Jornada
del Muerto</i> is understood by it." Doniphan's troops were more than three
days in making the jornada: Hughes, Don. Exp., 1847, p. 95. Here the road
left the river valley by a contadero, and passed on to the desert. The first
lap of the jornada was 26 m. to the Laguna del Muerto, usually dry, sometimes
holding water after a rain. (Pike lays this down rather too far N., as the
"Lago del munto" by mistake of the engraver.) Thus when Gregg passed in
1839, "there was not even a vestige of water," <i>l. c.</i>, p. 73. "The marshes,"
he continues, "said by some historians to be in the vicinity, are nowhere to be
found; nothing but the firmest and dryest table land is to be seen in every
direction. To procure water for our thirsty animals, it is often necessary to
make a halt here, and drive them to the Ojo del Muerto (Dead Man's Spring),
five or six miles to the westward, in the very heart of the mountain ridge that
lay between us and the river. This region is one of the favorite resorts of the
Apaches, where many a poor arriero has met with an untimely end. The
route which leads to the spring winds for two or three miles down a narrow
cañon or gorge, overhung on either side by abrupt precipices, while the various
clefts and crags, which project their gloomy brows over the abyss below, seem
to move the murderous savage to deeds of horror and blood." The second lap
of the jornada was 28 m. to a place called Perillo (qu: same as Barilla?), to be
found on present maps as Point of Rocks, where water may be found in holes.
The third stage was 23 m., finishing the jornada in the vicinity of Fort Selden.
This total of 77 m.&mdash;easily becoming the "90" of tradition&mdash;could be made
in two days, as Pike says; the usual method being to cover the distance in three
marches of a night, next day, and the following night. The road itself is not
bad; only the possibility or probability of 77 m. without water made it a terror.
As may be seen even from the map on the railroad folder, the jornada was
nearly coincident with the present line from Contadero due S.; but the
track leaves the river a little higher up, and strikes it again also higher up, at
Rincon. The first portion of the track runs through mal pais, as they call
ground strewn with rough and gritty fragments of lava, which makes traveling
bad; there is a station called Lava from this circumstance, and also a certain
Lava Butte, near the station Pope. The rails continue by Crocker and Round
mt. to the station Eagle, whence a road goes off W. to the Fort McRae reservation;
stations further along are Cutler, Upham, and Granada, the last being near
the Point of Rocks, formerly called Perillo, near where the stage station used to
be; whence the run is into Rincon, at a point on the river opposite Angostura,
where Pike comes along on the 17th. A camping-ground on the river, at this
end of the jornada, was known as Robledo (Oaks).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-26" id="Footnote_IP-26" href="#FNanchor_IP-26"><span class="label">[I'-26]</span></a> The whole of this way is bad, being cut across by a series of arroyos or
gulches making down from the San Mateo and Mimbres ranges. These mountains
are a part of the general chain which Pike maps in linear continuity as one
which forms the "Dividing Ridge between the Waters of Rio del Norte and
those of the Gulf of California"&mdash;that is, the Continental Divide. At one
point in these ranges Pike legends very conspicuously "Grand Copper Mines,
worked." It is also shown on the map of Lieut.-Col. Philip St. George Cooke,
of his route from the Rio Grande to the Gila, etc., in 1846-47, Ex. Doc. No. 41,
30th Cong., 1st Sess., pub. 1848; and a "view of the copper mine" forms the
subject of the plate opp. p. 59 of the same volume, in Lieut. W. H. Emory's
report: see also <i>ibid.</i>, A. R. Johnston's report, pp. 577, 578 fig. The headwaters
of the Rio Gila are across the divide of the Mimbres range. As the
party goes down the valley of the Rio Grande, say from the Nogal arroyo or the
site of the village now called San José, opposite Fra Cristobal, 6,600 feet, they
have the range of the latter name on the left, or E., immediately across the
river, while the San Mateo peak, 10,200 feet, towers on the N. W.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-27" id="Footnote_IP-27" href="#FNanchor_IP-27"><span class="label">[I'-27]</span></a> Before coming to his Horse mt., Pike passed several points of note. He
crossed Rio Alamoso or Cañada Alamosa near camp (unless he was already beyond
it), and next Rio Cuchillo Negro. Between these two, but off on the E. side of
the river, was built Fort McRae, in the southern foothills of the Fra Cristobal
range (vicinity of Elephant Butte and Ojo del Muerto). There is or was a crossing
of the Rio Grande from the fort, called Fest's ferry. Horse mt. of Pike is
now called Caballo Cone; it rises at the N. extremity of the range of the Horse
mts., usually known by the Spanish name of Sierra de los Caballos. The Mt. of
the Dead is another elevation of this range, but which one is less easily determined.
It was at or near the S. end of this range; see the positions of "Horse
M<sup>n.</sup>" and "Dead M<sup>n.</sup>" on the map. Pike also marks a mountain close to his
trail, on the W., by the name of "Rabledillo." This I take to be Cerro
Cuchillo Negro, opposite Caballo Cone, between Rio Cuchillo Negro and Rio
Palomo (Pigeon cr.). The latter is crossed at its mouth (Los Palomos); Rio
Animas is crossed (Brent's); and several arroyos or dry washes are passed, till the
party is well down on the W. side of the Horse range, within some 25 m. of where
the Rio Grande will be crossed to-morrow. Camp is apparently between the
mouths of Rio Perchas and Cienega Apache, which fall in near together on the
W. Hillsborough, seat of Sierra Co. (which Pike entered when he left Socorro
Co. on the 15th), is situated about 20 m. up Rio Perchas. Near this camp, and
nearly opposite his Dead mt., Pike marks an elevation by the name of "La
Ranchero," which appears to be that which approaches the Rio Grande most
closely between Cienega Apache and White Water cr. In any event, this is
one of the foothills of the Mimbres range, as are several others Pike maps in
this vicinity. See <a href="#Footnote_IP-28">next note</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-28" id="Footnote_IP-28" href="#FNanchor_IP-28"><span class="label">[I'-28]</span></a> Not 26 m. after crossing the river, but from last camp, from which it is
about 26 m. to make the crossing. In this trip Pike turns the W. and S. flank
of the Sierra de los Caballos or Horse mts., having these first E. and then N. of
his route (on his left all the way). In so doing he passes from Sierra into Dona
Ana Co., and goes by a number of notable points, some of which he maps. On
the W. side of the river, in Dona Ana Co., at or near present Santa Barbara,
was the site of old Fort Thorn and the old Indian Agency; Beck's ferry was
also hereabouts. Pike sets four mountains on his right, at different distances to
the W. and S. These are lettered (1) "Esterolargo," (2) "S. Jacomb," (3) "La
Salmera," (4) "Piadro." These are some of the most elevated points in the
rugged and irregularly broken country to the south of the Horse and Mimbres
ranges; and their relative positions as mapped by Pike agree so well with those
of certain well-known elevations that identifications may be attempted: (1)
Esterolargo seems to correspond to the Cerro Magdalen, between Fort Selden
on the E. and old Fort Cummings on the W. (2) is in the position of the Good
Sight mts., about half-way between the Magdalens and Fort Cummings. A
branch of the A., T., and S. F. R. R., from Rincon on the Rio Grande to
Deming, runs past the Magdalens (station Sellers) and thence through the Good
Sight mts. by Burr's Pass (station Nutt), between Good Sight Peak and Sunday
Cone. Fort Cummings was built in that southern extension of the Mimbres
range known as Cooke's range: leave railroad for the fort at Cummings station,
or keep on past Coleman to Deming, etc. (3) is Cerro Robledo, on W. bank of
the Rio Grande, immediately S. of Fort Selden. (4) may be intended for the
Florida mts., on the boundary between Dona Ana and Grant cos., directly S. of
Fort Cummings 20 and 30 m., not so far S. E. of Deming. Pike crosses the
Rio Grande from W. to E., at or near where the railroad now crosses in passing
between stations Hatch (Colorado) and Rincon; camp at this place or in its
immediate vicinity, about opposite town of Angostura.</p>

<p class="footnote">The practically identical language of Mar. 17th and 18th shows that Pike has
duplicated an entry, and consequently that one day's march has been lost.
This loss is irretrievable, so far as I can discover. Furthermore, we have no
mileages for the 19th and 20th. Under these circumstances the best we can do
is to march him into El Paso in three laps, set three camps <i>ex hypothesi</i>, and
note in due order the places on the road over which we know he passed.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-29" id="Footnote_IP-29" href="#FNanchor_IP-29"><span class="label">[I'-29]</span></a> To camp at some point between Fort Selden and Dona Ana, probably not
far beyond the site of the former post. The Military Reservation upon which
this long noted fort was established includes a tract a few miles square on both
sides of the river, between the Cerro Robledo on the S. and San Diego mt. on
the N. and N. W.; eastward are some elevations known as the Dona Ana hills;
the Cerro Magdalen is due W., but at a much greater distance. A few miles
below Rincon and Angostura the river enters the Selden cañon, where it is
straitened between Mt. San Diego on the E. and highlands on the W.; the railroad
traverses this cañon, with the stations Tonuco near its head and Randall
below; the position of the fort is between the latter and Leasburg, on the E.
bank of the river. Pike's map shows a marked bend or loop of the dotted trail
of the 18th, and I suppose this indicates where he went around Mt. San Diego.
There used to be a place called San Diego here, about opposite the point
where the old Cooke trail left the river. Dona Ana was founded on the E.
bank of the river, say 60 m. by road from El Paso. This town was started in
or about 1839, by settlers from El Paso, and 10 years later had a population of
300, mostly Mexicans, who required the protection of the military from the
Apaches. The railroad passes by but not through the present town, which has
given name to the county, though the county seat is at Las Cruces. Both of
these places are included in the Dona Ana Bend Colony tract.</p>

<p class="footnote">The Cooke trail above mentioned is that made by Lieut.-Col. Philip St.
George Cooke, commanding the Mormon battalion of the Army of the West on
the march from Santa Fé, N. M., to San Diego, Cal., under the guidance of
Antoine Leroux, in the autumn of 1846. It will be found very clearly traced,
from the point of departure from the Rio Grande to the Pima villages on the
Gila, on the sketch-map accompanying that officer's report to General Kearny,
Ex. Doc. No. 41, 30th Congr., 1st Sess., pub 1848, pp. 549-563. It is a roundabout
way which loops far S. and strikes the San Pedro several days' march
above the confluence of that stream with the Gila, follows the San Pedro down
a piece northward, then strikes westward to Tucson, and so on N. W. to the
Gila at the Pima villages. The distance is represented to have been 544 m.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-30" id="Footnote_IP-30" href="#FNanchor_IP-30"><span class="label">[I'-30]</span></a> Fra Cristobal, that is, but to be distinguished from Pike's <i>Sierra</i> Christopher:
see <a href="#Footnote_IP-23">note<sup>23</sup>, p. 633</a>, and <a href="#Footnote_IP-25">note<sup>25</sup>, p. 635</a>. The road which Pike thus
struck was in direct continuation of the Jornada del Muerto, on the way to El
Paso, and led by Las Cruces, present seat of Dona Ana Co. This has been for
many years one of the best-known places on the Rio Grande between Santa Fé
and El Paso; it is located a little off the river, on the E. side. In the vicinity
of Las Cruces, on the E. bank of the river, is Messilla, another well-known
town. The party proceeded past Tortugas and Bosquecito, to a point somewhere
beyond the site of old Fort Fillmore, and probably within the present limits of
the Brazito tract. This camp might be fixed more exactly by one who could
say how far short it was of a certain salt lake likely to be reached at 10 a. m.
next day. The route along here, as indeed from Fort Selden, is practically
coincident with that of the railroad. Brazito became the famous name of a
battle-ground, after Christmas Day of 1846, when Colonel Doniphan's regiment
defeated and routed a superior force of Mexicans who attacked him. A spirited
account of this engagement is given by John T. Hughes, Don. Exp. 1847, pp.
96-99, including a plan of the battle-ground. The engagement lasted half an
hour, about 3 p. m. The spot is given as "25 m." from El Paso, opposite a
large island in the Rio Grande, and also opposite a pass between the lower end
of the Organ mts. and others called the "White" mts. The Mexicans numbered
about 1,300 men, of whom 71 were killed, 5 taken prisoners, and not less
than 150 wounded, including their general, Ponce de Leon; the American
casualty was 8 wounded&mdash;none killed.</p>

<p class="footnote">On Pike's left as he passes stand the Organ or Organon mts., as now so called
in strictness, being that southward continuation of the San Andreas range which
is marked off by a gap from the rest of the chain. This gap is the San Augustin
Pass; place there called Organ, 15 m. E. by N. from Dona Ana. Pike charts
these mountains: see <a href="#Footnote_IP-23">note<sup>23</sup>, p. 631</a>. They run about S., and as the river is here
bearing S. S. E., the two approach within 10 to 5 m. in the vicinity of the
place where Fort Fillmore stood. Pike's "Sierra de la Cola," as laid down
close to the river, but due E. of El Paso, appears to correspond with what is
now known as the Franklin range, around which the river finally turns E. to
escape from all confinement. Along the Rio Grande itself his map marks
nothing whatever from the vicinity of Fort Selden to El Paso. But we are now
approaching some of the most important points of the whole route.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-31" id="Footnote_IP-31" href="#FNanchor_IP-31"><span class="label">[I'-31]</span></a> In the vicinity of Montoyo, Tex., in the extreme W. corner of the State.
Passing successively Mesquite, Herron, and Lyndon, on the railroad, with San
Miguel (Baca Grant), La Mesa, and Chamberino in succession on the other side
of the river, Pike comes to the station Anthony and the parallel of 32° N.; on
crossing which he goes from Dona Ana Co., N. M., into El Paso Co., Tex., as
he proceeds down the left or E. bank of the river; had he been on the other
side he would have remained in New Mexico until he entered present Chihuahua
at lat. 31° 47´ N. For the course of the Rio Grande itself makes the irregular
boundary of Texas for 15 or 20 m., from the point where the parallel of 32° N.
strikes the river from the E., to that where the parallel of 31° 47´ N. leaves the
river on the W. This break or fault (as a miner would say of a lead that acted
so) of the straight border between Texas and New Mexico, where the boundary
slips 13´ S. down the Rio Grande, is one of the politico-geographical curiosities
of the situation, which would only be fully understood upon mastering the complicated
history of the U. S. and Mexican Boundary Survey in all the bitterness
of its personal episodes. Some of these points are considered in the <a href="#Footnote_IP-32">following
note</a>. From lat. 31° 47´ N. on the Rio Grande, in the immediate vicinity of El
Paso, Tex., and of El Paso del Norte (Ciudad Juarez), in Chihuahua, the river
forms the boundary between the United States and the Republic of Mexico&mdash;that
is, between Texas and the Mexican States of Chihuahua, Coahuila,
Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas&mdash;on a circuitous but in general S. E. course to
the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IP-32" id="Footnote_IP-32" href="#FNanchor_IP-32"><span class="label">[I'-32]</span></a> The celebrated place to which our friend has thus been conducted by his
friends, the enemy, must not be confounded with our little town of El Paso,
Tex. This grew up yesterday, so to speak; that dates from about 1680, as
a Spanish settlement begun after the great Pueblo revolt, when Governor Otermin's
people were driven out of Santa Fé. Before Pike was welcomed by the
civil and ecclesiastical dignitaries of El Paso del Norte, he crossed the great
river, and thus passed from the State of Texas into that of Chihuahua, as these
are now bounded. He would have said that he simply went across the river
which flows in the province of North or New Mexico of the kingdom of New
Spain, and had not yet reached the province of New Biscay. But aside from
any of the political affairs which spoil the complexion of the maps, El Paso
is one of the most remarkable positions in North America, unique in some
respects. With regard to the tide of emigration which set westward by southern
lines of travel to the California of the forty-niners, it is comparable with
that place by which, from time immemorial, the nations have passed from
Asia into Europe, along what has been fitly styled the "highway of the
world." But El Paso is not only a half-way house from the Gulf of
Mexico to that of California; it is the continental cross-roads. For the
ebb and flow of human tides set with conflicting currents, north and south,
long before the first page of American history was traced, and will continue
forever in motion by El Paso. There is the turning-point of that great river
which was Rio del Norte above this pass, and Rio Grande or Rio Bravo
below. "El Paso" is certainly, as it always has been, the place of fording
or crossing the river&mdash;Gregg says it was called by Americans "The Pass,"
and speaks of "Pass wine" and "Pass whiskey," as they named the liquors
made there&mdash;but that is not the implication of the name. "El Paso" is the
mountain-pass&mdash;el paso del Rio del Norte&mdash;the place where the river passes
from the mountains to the plains. We have traced it from Pike's stockade
on the Conejos, in the San Luis valley, almost due S., in an immense
trough of several hundred miles' length, during the whole of which distance
it has been seen to be closely confined to its mountain bed, hemmed in on the
W. by the continental divide or its several outliers, on the E. by successive
ranges of not less dignity and importance. In all this course it receives no
more than mere creeks from the eastern side; while from the W. its tributaries
are comparatively few and small rivers. But at El Paso the river turns out
of bed, so to say, with hardly a figure of speech, to go all abroad in the open
country, drawing to itself large tributaries on its way to the sea. Yet it has
another strait-jacketing to suffer in forcing its way through the last mountains
that rise to obstruct its course. The struggle begins near the entrance
of the Rio Conchas and in the vicinity of Presidio del Norte, one of the
oldest establishments in northern Mexico; it continues for many miles through
a series of cañons in the Bofecillos, San Carlos, and other mountains. During
this passage the river makes a sharp elbow from S. E. northward, and then
with a bold sweep recovers its former course; it receives its tribute from the
Pecos, its largest branch; then, freed from its last fetters and augmented in
force, the Rio Grande winds its way to the Gulf, having well won the title
"Bravo." Such action is the more to be applauded if we remember that above
the cañon-formations the river sometimes sinks exhausted into the ground, and
its bed may become for many miles a wagon-road. The great flexures of the
river lie within about a degree of latitude (29° to 30° N.), and the series of cañons
is between the 102d and 105th meridians. Major Emory speaks of that great
bend of the river as "one of the most remarkable features on the face of the
globe&mdash;that of a river traversing at an oblique angle a chain of lofty mountains,
and making through these, on a gigantic scale, what is called in Spanish
America a cañon&mdash;that is, a river hemmed in by vertical walls," U. S. and
Mex. B. Surv. I. 1857, p. 42. With due deference, and no desire to derogate
from the dignity, either of the Rio Grande or of its cañonation, I do not
see that we have not several parallel cases in this country, some of which
are on a scale of not inferior magnitude. The essential features of the case
are those of a great river which has once left its bed in mountains about its
origin, traversed open country, and then forced its way through cañon-formation
in another range or spur. The Arkansaw, heading in the continental
divide, breaks out upon the plain at Cañon City, through a chasm in another
range. The South Platte traverses South Park, and the North Platte, North
Park, to seek the plains through other mountains than those in which they
respectively head. The Yellowstone has its upper cañon and then comes out
at Livingston through a lower one. The Missouri itself leaves its sources far
remote from the range through which it finally makes its exit from Lewis and
Clark's Gates of the Rocky Mountains. And just think of the Columbia!</p>

<p class="footnote">Pike has nothing to say of any place on the Rio Grande opposite the
Mexican town of El Paso, at or near where El Paso stands in Texas. But
the valley has been settled and cultivated from remote antiquity, and the clustering
of the population at various points gave rise to towns or pueblos, all of
which, of course, had names, though several of these have lapsed forever.
Maps now nearly half a century old mark on the Texan side several places
by the names of Frontera, La Frontera, or Las Fronteras; Isleta, a Tañoan
pueblo (in what is now Texas&mdash;distinguish from the other Tañoan pueblo,
Isleta, in New Mexico); Socorro; San Elceario, or Elizario; also, Franklin
and Fort Bliss&mdash;all these before there was any El Paso in Texas. Present
maps show, below Montoyo, Santa Teresa, Frontera, El Paso, Isleta, San
Elizario, and so on down the river along the railroad. As to the germ of the
American town of El Paso, we find that Captain S. G. French, in 1849, came
up the Rio Grande "to the intersection of the Santa Fé road at the rancho
opposite El Paso"; and again: "El Paso is wholly situated in Mexico&mdash;there
being, excepting the three villages on the island [San Elizario, Socorro, Isleta],
but three houses on the American side." French's mileages by odometer in
coming up the river on the Texan side, are: San Elizario to Socorro, 5.45 m.;
Socorro to Isleta, 3.10; Isleta to Upper Ford, 7.05; Upper Ford to Coon's
Hacienda, 7.09; total, 22.69, or 22&#8532; m. from San Elizario to where the Santa
Fé road came to the river to cross to El Paso, Mex. (Reports of Reconn., etc.,
8vo, Washington, 1850, p. 53&mdash;not a book very easy to find.) A table of distances
in the reverse direction and bringing in two more of the above names,
is furnished by Major Emory, U. S. and M. B. S., I. 1857, p. 135: Franklin
(opposite El Paso) to Fort Bliss, 2 m.; Fort Bliss to Isleta, 12.14; Isleta to
Socorro, 3.10; Socorro to San Elceario, 5.45; total, 22.69, or 22&#8532; m., as
before. If these were independent measurements, the odometers must have
been good, as well as the road; but I cite them both to show that Coon's
Hacienda, Franklin, and El Paso, Tex., were the same place, opposite El
Paso, Mex., and that Fort Bliss was built 2 m. lower down. Writing of the
early fifties, Emory also states, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 91: "From San Elceario up to El
Paso, a distance by the sinuosities of the river of 30 miles, but by air-line of
only 20 miles, is almost one continuous settlement of Mexicans and Pueblo
Indians, with here and there an American farmer and trader." His estimates
of the population all along, from El Paso, Mex., to San Elceario, are: El Paso
(including the very ancient Tañoan pueblo of Sinecu, supposed to have been
built before the Spaniards came), 4,000; Franklin (present El Paso, Tex.), 200;
Socorro, 300; San Elceario, 1,200; with 1,300 at places still further down,
making a total of 7,000. Isleta does not figure in this census. This population
was mostly mixed, with little pure Spanish, or Indian either. The commercial
importance of El Paso as a port of entry may be inferred from Emory's statement
that, before the ports on the lower Rio Bravo were opened, for some years as
much as $2,000,000 worth of goods passed into Mexico this way; figures supposed
to have been reduced more than one-half at the time of which he wrote.
He describes the town of El Paso, Mex., as "one extended vineyard in the
hands of many proprietors." The little town of Frontera, above mentioned,
acquired some consequence in 1852 from the erection there in 1851 of one of
the astronomical stations at which Major Emory, U. S. Commissioner, and
Don José Salazar y Larregui, Comisionado Mexicano, determined the initial
point of the boundary W. of the Rio Grande along the par. of 31° 47´ N. The
position of Frontera, as decided and agreed upon by the Joint Commission, was
lat. 31° 48´ 44.31´´ N., long. 106° 33´ 04.5´´ W. That of El Paso, Mex., or
more exactly, of the cathedral in that place, was lat. 31° 44´ 15.7´´ N., long.
166° 29´ 05.4´´ W. Frontera was thus about 4 minutes N. and W. of El Paso,
and the boundary started W. between these two places at a point 3.41 m.
about N. W. of El Paso, and 2.70 m. about S. E. of Frontera; the total
distance between these two places being 6.11 m. As the Rio Grande itself was
the natural boundary agreed upon from the Gulf of Mexico to the point where
the river should intersect the parallel of 31° 47´, the various questions that were
to be determined concerned only the boundary thence W. across country to the
Gulf of California and so on to the Pacific. Two different boundaries were in
diplomatic agreement for some years before either of them was ascertained on
the ground. These were those provided for by the treaty of Guadalupe
Hidalgo, Feb. 2d, 1848, ratified Aug., 1848, and by the Gadsden treaty of
Dec. 30th, 1853, ratified June 30th, 1854. Under the former of these, two
abortive attempts were made to establish two different lines W. of the Rio
Grande; and it was fortunate for us that neither of them succeeded. The old
treaty was made in the dark, on our part at least, being based upon the ignorance
of geography which Disturnell's map displayed in 1847. The old treaty
line started on paper from the Rio Grande at a point some miles above Frontera,
went W. on a certain parallel of latitude, hypothetical on the ground, for
about 180 m., through the Chiricahua mts., and then turned due N. along a
never-determined meridian till it struck Rio Gila, which was thence the boundary
W. to the Rio Colorado. The line agreed upon by U. S. Commissioner John
B. Weller and General Conde, the Comisionado Mexicano, started W. from the
Rio Grande at a point in the vicinity of Dona Ana, ran along a parallel for
the same distance as the other, and then turned N. on a meridian to the Gila,
striking the latter at a point further down that river&mdash;further N. W., that is,
owing to the difference of longitude of the initial point on the Rio Grande.
Both of these were paper-lines, assumed when the two governments were feeling
for S. and W. borders of New Mexico as laid down on Disturnell's map;
for Article V. of the G. H. '48 treaty provided that from the intersection of
the Rio Grande with the S. border of New Mexico (wherever that might be)
the line should run W. along the whole S. border of New Mexico, and then
turn N. along the W. border of the same to the Gila. This was decidedly a
case of <i>obscurum per obscurius</i>, so far as laying down an actual line was concerned,
for nobody knew where the S. and W. borders of New Mexico were,
within several minutes of latitude and longitude. The Weller-Conde line
above noted started from the Rio Grande at lat. 32° 22´, near Dona Ana, and
went due W. upon an assumed S. boundary of N. M. In 1851 such an initial
point had been agreed upon; a monument erected; and actual survey begun
by Col. J. D. Graham. The other assumed S. boundary of N. M., along
which a line was projected W. of the Rio Grande from an initial point in the
vicinity of Frontera, was very near 31° 47´. Both luckily failed to go into
effect. Such a comedy of errors, beginning on a false basis, was conducted
through a tissue of blunders to an inevitable and fortunate fiasco. The work
of the old boundary survey was prosecuted under a series of commissioners&mdash;John
B. Weller; John C. Frémont, who accepted the appointment, but never
got on the ground, and did nothing but resign; John R. Bartlett; and Robert
B. Campbell. It wound up in 1853 as an ignominious and acrimonious failure,
for which net result Congress had appropriated $787,112. This was expensive,
but profitable in the end; for the event proved that a different boundary would
come cheap at that or almost any other price. Almost down to 1848, the topography
of the country between the Rio Grande and the Colorado of the West
was practically unknown to Americans. But adventurers, traders, and emigrants
had begun to set their faces toward the west along our borders; and the question
of the most practicable southern route became one of great and growing
importance. The War Department put exploring parties in the field; and
through the labors of such officers as Emory, Abert, Parke, Marcy, Sitgreaves,
Simpson, Whipple, Michler, J. E. Johnston, S. G. French, W. F. Smith, F. T. Bryan,
and others, new light was thrown upon a vast region, to much of
which El Paso was the key. Among other things, Emory developed the fact
that there could be no thoroughfare through U. S. territory in the vicinity of
32° N., the country being practically impassable by any means of transportation
then available along the parallel of 32°, N. of the projected boundary. The
G. H. treaty '48, to use Emory's words, "fixed a line north of that parallel which
cut off entirely the communication by wagons between the rivers [Rios Grande
and Gila]; and leaving out of view the considerations involved in securing
railway routes to the Pacific, it was a line which sooner or later must have been
abandoned. No traveller could pass, nor could a dispatch be sent, from a
military post on the Rio Bravo to one on the Gila, without passing through
Mexican territory." Our Mexican neighbors evidently knew their country, as
well as what they were about, much better than we did, until we learned to
our cost what the matter was. The already notorious errors of the Disturnell
map made any adjustment of the difficulty on that basis impossible, and some
different understanding between the two countries became an obvious necessity.
This was effected by the Gadsden treaty of 1853, which provided for the
reconstruction of the international line on paper, and its determination on the
ground. By the provisions of this agreement, the line was to run up the Rio
Grande, as already defined by the G. H. treaty '48, to the point where the middle
of the river should intersect the parallel of 31° 47´ N.; thence due W. 100 m.;
thence due S. to the parallel of 31° 20´ N.; thence due W. to the meridian of
111° W.; thence in a straight line to a point on the Colorado r. 20 English
miles below the confluence of the Gila; thence up the Colorado r. to the intersection
of the already existing U. S. and Mexican line across California to the
Pacific. The concessions represented by these terms were all-important to us;
they not only secured the required practicable highway from the Rio Grande to
the Gila, but added 26,185 sq. m. to U. S. territory, as was discovered when
the line was run. This tract lies between the parallels of 31° 20´ and 33° 30´
N., and between the meridians of 106° 30´ and 114° W.; it may be called, in a
phrase, so much of the U. S. as lies S. of the Gila, in New Mexico and mainly
in Arizona. William Hensley Emory was commissioned by President Pierce,
Aug. 4th, '54, to carry out the provisions of the treaty on the part of the U. S.,
and Don José Salazar y Larregui was appointed to the same official functions
on the part of Mexico. Major Emory was required to meet the Mexican
commissioner at El Paso by Oct. 1st, 1854, and the commission took the field
without delay. Congress appropriated $168,130, Aug. 14th, '54, and $71,450,
Mar. 3d, '55; total, $239,580, for running and marking the line. When the
work had been done, Jan. 1st, 1856, Major Emory reported an unexpended balance
of $98,454.59. He had also to turn in, as unexpended balance of certain appropriations
for the old commission (altogether $58,100), the sum of $37,345.53;
total to his credit, $135,800.12, remaining of the sum of $239,580 + $58,100 =
$297,680, of which he had the disbursement and was responsible. It thus appears
that his whole work cost the government only $161,879.87; it was finished within
the time estimated by the government for its completion, and largely within the
amounts appropriated for the purpose. The boundary run by Emory and
Salazar, respectively, agreed upon by them jointly, and accepted by both governments,
is at present in effect. It starts from the Rio Grande between El Paso
and Frontera, at 31° 47´, and runs W. on that parallel 100 m., to a certain spot
commonly referred to by the name of Carrizalillo, as that of the nearest named
locality; thence it drops meridionally to the parallel of 31° 20´, at a nameless
place in the mountains; thence it runs due W. to the intersection of the 111th
meridian at a well-known place, Los Nogales; whence it runs obliquely to the
Colorado r., at a point which is (roundly) 20 m. S. of Fort Yuma by the
channel of the river&mdash;Yuma being on the W. bank, and practically opposite the
mouth of the Gila. Aside from any question of the 25,185 sq. m. and
the desirable right of way thus secured, under the provisions of the Gadsden
treaty, the abrogation of the 11th article of the G. H. treaty was all-important
to the U. S. "This article," to use Major Emory's words, "made it incumbent
on the United States to keep the Indians living within our own territory from
committing depredations on the Mexicans, and by implication imposed on the
United States the obligation of indemnity for all losses resulting from failure
to carry out the provisions of the treaty. No amount of force could have kept
the Indians from crossing the line to commit depredations, and I think that
one hundred millions would not pay the damages they have inflicted. Whole
sections of country have been depopulated and the stock driven off and killed;
and in entire States the ranches have been deserted and the people driven into
the towns. It is true, all this has not been done since the war [with Mexico],
and would form no just claim against the United States; but those conversant
with the history of Mexican claims will at once admit that the United States
would have been fortunate if she could have escaped with paying real claims
for depredations, whether committed before or after the war. I should not be
true to history if I did not state what is within my own personal knowledge&mdash;that
companies were formed, and others forming, composed of persons of
wealth, influence, and adroitness, who projected extensive schemes for the
purchase of these claims, with the view of extorting them from the Congress of
the United States." Not the least admirable feature of the present treaty, and
one which was of equal moment to all respectable citizens of both countries, was
the fullness of the powers it vested in the two commissioners. For Art. I. has:
"That line shall be alone established upon which the commissioners may fix,
their consent in this particular being considered decisive and an integral part of
this treaty, without necessity of ulterior ratification or approval, and without
room for interpretation of any kind by either of the parties contracting." This
kept the dirty hands of professional politicians out of the affair, and left it to
be settled by two honorable and able men, free to act at their best judgment
and discretion, besides being competent to the requisite scientific work in
astronomy and geodesy. The joint commission, in session on the spot, agreed
upon the initial point of 31° 47´ N. on the W. bank of the Rio Grande, Jan.
10th, 1855; they marked it and agreed to erect the monument there. The
corner-stone was laid Jan. 31st, in the presence of each other and of various
civil and military dignitaries. The commissioners reconvened at Fort Bliss,
Aug. 14th-16th, 1855, to consider the operations which had meanwhile been
carried on by themselves and their respective assistants; whereupon they agreed
to declare and did declare the line surveyed, marked, and established as far W.
as the 111th meridian, and from the 111th meridian to the Colorado r.; they
further agreed, etc., that the whole of the line should be declared fully established,
etc., and the field-work concluded, whenever each should notify the
other that certain topographical work then in progress had been completed by
Lieutenant Michler and Señor Jimenez; whereupon, having no further business,
the commission adjourned to meet in Washington, D. C., Apr. 1st, 1856.
The required notifications were exchanged Oct. 15th and Dec. 18th, 1855.
The work had been done, and subsequent proceedings were only in the nature of
formalities between the two governments. My authority for the facts embodied
in this note is of course the U. S. and M. B. S. Report unless otherwise
stated. I have been led into this sketch of affairs of 40 years ago, partly by
their intrinsic interest, but mainly because they show the state of things at a
period of time equidistant between Pike's and the present day.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-1" id="Footnote_IIP-1" href="#FNanchor_IIP-1"><span class="label">[II'-1]</span></a> The difficulty of trailing Pike in Mexico is twofold. His notes, hasty and
stealthy under the circumstances, are necessarily meager, and rather excite than
satisfy our curiosity to know more. Worse than this, all the maps of Mexico
are poor. I have probably before me the best maps that exist; they do not
compare with those we have used for most parts of Pike's route. The most
helpful one I have found is that in Senate Misc. Doc. No. 26, 30th Cong., 1st
Sess., accompanying a Memoir of a Tour to Northern Mexico, connected with
Col. Doniphan's Expedition, in 1846 and 1847, by A. Wislizenus, M. D.,
Washington, Tippin and Streeper, 1848, 8vo, pp. 141. The author was a German
scientist, interested in geography, geology, and botany. He went over
much of the identical route which Pike traveled,&mdash;as far as Parras, near Saltillo,&mdash;and
has left a luminous itinerary, for the publication of which we are
indebted to the good sense of Thomas H. Benton. This I shall draw heavily
upon, and wish to make my grateful compliments to its author in the beginning
of this route.</p>

<p class="footnote">The <i>Fort</i> "Elisiaira" which Pike has just left must not be confounded with
the place on the river called Elizario, Eleazario, Elceario, etc., and described in
my last note. He is starting S., on the main road, and the place where the
gambling dovetailed so well with religion was the Presidio San Elizario, on the
boundary between the then Provinces of North Mexico and New Biscay. Two
roads led from El Paso to Carrizal, the principal place en route to Chihuahua.
One of these went down the Rio Grande for several miles before it turned S.
from that river, taking this roundabout way to avoid Los Medanos (the Sand
Hills, of which more presently). The other, which Pike took, went directly
S., approximately by the way the railroad goes now. To the right is a range
of mountains; the valley of the Rio Grande recedes to the left; the way is
over a sandy, shrubby plain, in some places so strewn with a kind of white limestone
as to have given the name Tierra Blanca. Camp is at the place which
Pike calls by the extraordinary term of "Ogo mall a Ukap" and charts as "Ojo
Malalka." Both these terms are otherwise rendered Ojo de Malayuque and
Samalayuca; and all these, with others I could cite, are forms of the name of
the same spring or pool which was a usual first camp out from El Paso. It was
in most seasons a necessary halt, on account of water in this long arid stretch,
as well as a desirable one to make before encountering the Sand Hills. Pike
charts two other bodies of water, off the road to the right or W., by the names
of "Lago de la Condelaria" and "Lac de Susma"; there are several such, in
fact, known as Palomas, Guzman, Durazno, Santa Maria, etc. Guzman is the
same word as Pike's "Susma," and a personal name very well known indeed in
Mexican history; but whether the same lake is another question. Candelaria is
the present name of a station on the railroad below Los Medanos.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-2" id="Footnote_IIP-2" href="#FNanchor_IIP-2"><span class="label">[II'-2]</span></a> Pike gives us nothing from Samalayuca to Carrizal, and we must fill the
lacuna from other sources of information. The way grows gradually hillier and
sandier, till it becomes all hills and sands. These are Los Medanos, dreaded
for the difficulty of hauling loaded wagons through them, though not so bad on
horseback or with pack-mules. Gregg describes the entourage, Comm. Pra., II.
1844, p. 79, as "a stupendous ledge of sand-hills, across which the road passes
for about six miles. As teams are never able to haul the loaded wagons over
this region of loose sand, we engaged an <i>atajo</i> of mules at El Paso, upon which
to convey our goods across. These Médanos consist of huge hillocks and ridges
of pure sand, in many places without a vestige of vegetation. Through the
lowest gaps between the hills the road winds its way." This description calls
to mind the Medano or Sand Hill Pass: see <a href="#Footnote_III-39">note<sup>39</sup>, p. 491</a>. Wislizenus is even
more vivid, Mem. p. 44: "Having arrived at the foot of the sand hills, we
commenced travelling very slow. There was nothing around us but the deepest
and purest sand, and the animals could only get along in the slowest walk, and
by resting at short intervals. At last my animals were exhausted; they would
move no more, and we had not yet reached half of our way. In this dilemma
I put my own riding-horse to the wagon. Mr. Jacquez lent me some additional
mules, and forward we moved again. In the meanwhile dark night had come
on, illuminated only by lightning, that showed us for a while the most appalling
night-scene&mdash;our wagons moving along as slow and solemn as a funeral procession;
ghastly riders on horseback, wrapped in blankets or cloaks; some tired
travellers stretched out on the sand, others walking ahead, and tracing the road
with the fire of their cigarritos; and the deepest silence, interrupted only by the
yelling exclamations of the drivers, and the rolling of distant thunder. The
scene was impressive enough to be remembered by me: but I made a vow the
same night, that whenever I should undertake this trip again, I would rather go
three days around, than travel once more over the sand hills with a wagon.
About midnight, at last we reached the southern end of the sand hills, and
encamped without water."</p>

<p class="footnote">This bad place was about 6 m. Beyond it, some 15 (?) m., is a fine spring of
water a few yards to the left, called Ojo Lucero or Venus' spring. A place on
the railroad in this vicinity is named Rancheria. Further on is seen, at some
distance to the right of the road, a square mound 20 feet high, with a warm
spring on its level top. Beyond this, on the left, is Laguna de Patos, or
Duck l., a considerable body of water, which is the sink of the Rio Carmen.
The other road from El Paso to Carrizal joins the main road in this vicinity.
San José is a place on the railroad, opposite this lake. Off to the right, in the
mountain chain above mentioned, rises a conspicuous picacho. Carrizal is
a small town, like most places in Mexico (pop. 300 or 400 in 1839), but for some
time supported a presidio or garrison as a protection from Indians, and was also
walled in; but neither of these defenses seems to have troubled the Apaches
much. Turning to Pike's map, we find he marks "Presidio de Carracal" on
a branch of a large "Rio de Carracal," which he runs N. E. into the Rio
Grande. But this is the Carmen r. just said, which runs into Duck l. not far
from where Pike makes it head, and probably never reaches the Rio Grande.
Yet it is liable to freshets and may greatly overflow its usual limits. Gregg
struck one when he passed this way in 1839 and describes it, <i>l. c.</i>: "Just as we
passed Lake Patos, we were struck with astonishment at finding the road ahead
of us literally overflowed by an immense body of water, with a brisk current, as
if some great river had suddenly been conjured into existence by the aid of
supernatural arts. A considerable time elapsed before we could unravel the
mystery. At last we discovered that a freshet had lately occurred in the streams
that fed Lake Patos and caused it to overflow its banks, which accounted for
this unwelcome visitation. We had to flounder through the mud and water for
several hours before we succeeded in getting across." The spring which Pike
marks "Ojo de Lotario" (Lothario) is that above named as Lucifer or Venus;
and the hill delineated close by it is probably intended for the mound above
said. He marks the road which leads from Carrizal to Sonora "Camino a
Senora."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-3" id="Footnote_IIP-3" href="#FNanchor_IIP-3"><span class="label">[II'-3]</span></a> Pike's "little fosse" is no doubt the acequia below Carrizal. Ojo Caliente
is present name of a station on the railroad between Carmen station and Las
Minas; and the warm springs where Pike camps are those at or near Alamo de
Peña, 10-12 m. below Carrizal, a mile short of the crossing of Rio Carmen.
Gregg and Wislizenus both describe the springs in similar terms, as forming
a large basin of clear, pure, lukewarm water in porphyritic rocks, with a sandy
bottom, fed from various sources, and overrunning in a rivulet into the Carmen.
"It forms," says Gregg, Com. Pra., II. p. 80, "a basin some 30 feet long by
about half that width, and just deep and warm enough for a most delightful
bath at all seasons of the year. Were this spring ... anywhere within the
United States it would doubtless soon be converted into a place of fashionable
resort." Wislizenus determined a temperature of 82° F., the air being
84½° F. Hughes in Doniphan's Exp., p. 108, also describes the spring and
states that it was formerly the seat of a princely hacienda, "belonging to Porus,
a Spanish nabob," who at one time had on his estate 36,000 head of stock.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-4" id="Footnote_IIP-4" href="#FNanchor_IIP-4"><span class="label">[II'-4]</span></a> A long, hard march over a plain waterless except in rainy weather, and
a dry camp; for though Pike is past the place he marks "Les Coquillas," he
stops short of the Ojo de Callejon.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-5" id="Footnote_IIP-5" href="#FNanchor_IIP-5"><span class="label">[II'-5]</span></a> This spring is found on various maps by the names of "Gallejo," "Gallego,"
etc., also applied to a station on the railroad. Hughes gives the word as
"Guyagas." I suppose the proper name to be Ojo de Callejon, which might
be translated Pass spring&mdash;for the mountains on each side of the road here close
in somewhat, leaving a pass or <i>puerta</i> between them. Otherwise, the word is
<i>callejo</i> or <i>calleyo</i>, meaning pitfall. This spring is off to the left, and sometimes
discharges water enough to make a rivulet, which crosses the road. One of the
other two springs which Pike speaks of passing is no doubt that known as
Callejito.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-6" id="Footnote_IIP-6" href="#FNanchor_IIP-6"><span class="label">[II'-6]</span></a> The text does not agree with the map, for on the latter a "Camino a
Senora" (road to Sonora) is brought into an unnamed "Ojo" which Pike has
already passed. There may have been more than one such road. In any
event, the spring which Pike passes on the 31st is that marked on his map
"Aqas nueva," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, Aguas Nuevas or Agua Nueva. A station on the railroad
has the latter name.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-7" id="Footnote_IIP-7" href="#FNanchor_IIP-7"><span class="label">[II'-7]</span></a> The hiatus in the text is to be filled by El Peñol or Hacienda del Petrero;
Pike marks "Delpetrero" on his map, the last place he notes before reaching
Chihuahua. Neither of those names appears on the late maps before me, but
both were formerly employed for the well-known locality. Wislizenus maps
El Peñol, where he camped Aug. 22d, 1846, and speaks of the place as a large
hacienda, 28 m. from his last camp (probably the same as Pike's of the 30th)
and about 40 m. from Chihuahua. "The creek of the same name passing by
the hacienda is the principal affluent of the lake of Encinillas; by the rains it
was swelled to a torrent, and its roaring waves, rushing over all obstacles,
sounded in the stillness of night like a cataract." Pike has not a word of this lake,
though it is usually a conspicuous feature of the great plain he has just traversed,
to the W. of the road. He maps it, quite small, by the name of "Lago de
S<sup>n.</sup> Martin." Laguna de las Encinillas, in English Lake of Live Oaks, is a
body of water whose extent varies greatly according to season and the weather,
being sometimes 15 or 20 m. long, though usually less than this; Wislizenus
estimated its length when he saw it to be 15 m., with a width of 3 m. on an
average. Gregg says, <i>tom. cit.</i>, p. 81: "This lake is ten or twelve miles long
by two or three in width, and seems to have no outlet during the greatest
freshets, though fed by several small constant-flowing streams from the surrounding
mountains. The water of this lake during the dry season is so strongly
impregnated with nauseous and bitter salts as to render it wholly unpalatable
to man and beast. The most predominant of these noxious substances is a
species of alkali, known there by the title of <i>tequesquite</i>. It is often seen
oozing out from the surface of marshy grounds, about the table plains of all
Northern Mexico, forming a grayish crust, and is extensively used in the manufacture
of soap, and sometimes by the bakers even for raising bread."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-8" id="Footnote_IIP-8" href="#FNanchor_IIP-8"><span class="label">[II'-8]</span></a> As Pike has not a word of the route from El Peñol to Chihuahua, we may
supply the omission from other sources. The approach to the capital presented
then, as it does now, a number of both artificial and natural features. There
were several settlements, as, for instance, Encinillas at the S. end of the lake,
and Sauz beyond this. Both of these are places to be found marked by the
same names now; the railroad runs through them. Further on, the road
crossed the Arroyo Seco, usually a dry gulch, as its name says, but sometimes
a creek not easily crossed, owing to depth of water. It flows eastward to fall
into the Sacramento a few miles below. About 3 m. beyond this arroyo is the
valley of the Sacramento, memorable since the battle which was won by the
Americans under Colonel Doniphan on Sunday the 28th of February, 1847. Says
Wislizenus, Mem. p. 47: "The mountains above the Sacramento approach
each other from the east and west, and narrow the intermediate plain to the
width of about six miles; and on the Sacramento itself, where new spurs of
mountains project, to about 3 miles. The road from the Arroyo Seco to the
Sacramento leads at first over a high plain; but as soon as the Sacramento
comes in sight, it descends abruptly to its valley and to the left bank of the
creek. Near where the road begins to descend, a ravine, with an opposite
long hill, runs to the left or east of it, and a level plain spreads out to the right
or west of it. On the hill towards the east was a continuous line of batteries
and intrenchments, and the principal force of the Mexican army was there collected.
On the opposite plain from the west, the American troops, who had
above the Arroyo Seco already turned to the right to gain a more favorable
position, advanced in open field against their entrenched and far more numerous
enemies. How the American artillery with the first opening of their fire struck
terror into the Mexican ranks; how the brave Missourians then, on horseback
and on foot, acted by one impulse, rushed through the ravine up to the cannon's
mouth, and, overthrowing and killing everything before them, took one battery
after the other, till the whole line of entrenchments was in their possession and
the enemy put to complete flight; how they crossed from here to the Sacramento
and stormed on its right bank the last fortified position, on a steep hill, till not
a Mexican was left to oppose them, and all their cannon, ammunition, and
trains were abandoned to the victors&mdash;these are facts well known in the history
of that campaign, and will immortalize the brave volunteers of Missouri."
A full account of the battle is given by the historian of Doniphan's Expedition,
p. 110 <i>seq.</i>, with a plan of the ground. The U. S. forces were 924 all told,
with 6 pieces of artillery; their loss was 1 killed and 11 wounded, 3 mortally.
The Americans had 140 additional men, teamsters and others, raising the total
to 1,164. Of the 924, 117 were of the artillery, 93 were of an escort, and the
remainder of the 1st Regt. Missouri mounted volunteers. The Mexicans had
4,224 men, and 16 pieces of artillery; their loss was 320 killed, 560 wounded,
72 prisoners. Hughes' article cited includes Colonel Doniphan's official report.</p>

<p class="footnote">The Sacramento is the stream upon two small tributaries of which Chihuahua
is situated, at their junction, about 20 m. from the scene described. The river
is usually fordable. The road leads over a level plain, which widens somewhat
southward, down the valley of the river, with steep, rough mountains on either
hand. The capital first comes in sight about 10 m. off, in a sort of pocket
where the mountains come together from each side, as if to close up the valley
below; but there is an outlet to the E. through which the Sacramento r. runs
to join the Rio Conchos.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-9" id="Footnote_IIP-9" href="#FNanchor_IIP-9"><span class="label">[II'-9]</span></a> B. Bucks Co., Pa., Jan. 24th, 1754, of Quaker parentage (his father was one of
those who had land on the Patapsco, and founded Ellicott's Mills, now Ellicott
City, near Baltimore, Md., 1774); became a distinguished astronomer, surveyor,
and civil engineer, and died professor of mathematics at West Point, N. Y., Aug.
29th, 1820. He did an immense amount of surveying and boundary-running,
mostly of important and official public character, in New York, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Virginia, and elsewhere; in 1790, was directed by Washington
to lay out the city of that name; in 1792 became surveyor-general of the U. S.;
and in 1796 was appointed by Washington U. S. Commissioner under the treaty
of San Lorenzo el Real, to run the southern boundary between the U. S. and
New Spain. This is the work to which Pike alludes, though he is a little out in
his dates, as witness the following title: The Journal of Andrew Ellicott, late
Commissioner on behalf of the United States during part of the year 1796, the
years 1797, 1798, 1799, and part of the year 1800: for determining the boundary
between the United States and the possessions of his Catholic Majesty in
America, containing, ... etc., Philada., Budd and Bartram, 1803, 1 vol. 4to,
pp. i-viii, 1-299, with 6 maps, and Appendix, pp. 1-151, 1 leaf errata, and 8
more maps. Ellicott wrote this book, excepting the Appendix, at Lancaster,
Pa., June to Nov., 1802; and while he was there in 1803 he coached Captain
Meriwether Lewis in the use of astronomical instruments: see L. and C., ed.
1893, p. xxii and p. xxiv. Going down the Ohio to the scene of his official functions,
Dec. 17th, 1796, Ellicott says, p. 21: "I passed the mouth of the Tennesee,
and in two hours afterwards arrived at Fort Massac, and was politely
received by the commandant Captain Pike," etc. This was Zebulon Pike,
father of Zebulon M.: see the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43774/43774-h/43774-h.htm#Page_XIX">Memoir
</a>, <i>anteà</i>. The fort stood on the N. (right)
bank, about lat. 37° 14´; early F. history obscure and not all of it authentic;
site supposed to have been first occupied <i>ca.</i> 1711: see Beck's Gaz., 1823, p.
114, and John Reynolds' Own Times, 2d. ed. p. 16, with description of the place
as it was in 1855. In descending the Ohio in 1758 the F. officer Aubry halted
on the N. bank, at the old site, called 36 m. above the mouth of the river, to
build a new post, which was garrisoned with 100 men and called Fort <i>Marsiac</i>
after the first commandant. Thus the name is not Massac, as usually said, and
still less is it derived from the apocryphal <i>massacre</i> which various historians
have exploited. This fort was the last establishment of the F. on the Ohio,
being kept up till they evacuated the country under the Treaty of Paris, 1763;
it was a U. S. post till after the war of 1812-14, and during our occupancy
became known as the old Cherokee fort. Pike alludes in the present work to a
certain <i>Nolan</i>, who is easy to identify, but not to find out much about. Ellicott
met him at the mouth of the Ohio, in Jan., 1797: "Mr. Philip Nolan, so well
known for his athletic exertions, and dexterity in taking wild horses, stopped at
our camp on his way from New Madrid to fort Massac," says this author, p. 29,
with a footnote stating that Nolan "was killed by the Spaniards in the spring
of 1801," after taking a very active part in various disturbances in that quarter.
Ellicott passed down the Miss. r., past the Chickasaw bluffs (L. and C., ed. 1893,
p. xl. and p. lii), and at Natchez encountered a bigger bluff in the shape of an
individual who described himself in his pronunciamentos as his Excellency
Francis Lewis Hector, Baron de Carondelet, Knight of the Order of Malta,
Major General of his Armies, Commandant General of Louisiana and West
Florida, Inspector of the Troops, Militia, etc., etc., etc. (though what his
triplicate etceteras were is not given to ordinary mortals to know). This climacteric
functionary was supported by a lesser luminary who filled the rôle of
Don Manuel Gayoso de Lemas, Brigadier of the Royal Armies, Governor of
Natchez and its dependencies, with three-ply etceteras as before (though he was
dead before Aug., 1799). These two formidable obstructions to navigation, as
an engineer might say, were not overcome by our surveyor-general for nearly a
year, during which period they kept him busy with Spanish diplomacy. As I
read the correspondence it seems to have largely consisted in saying they hoped
God would bless and keep him forever, when they really hoped the devil would
fly away with him before breakfast; and he had to silence both the caterwauling
choristers before he could proceed with his scientific work. This he was
free to do on the Spanish evacuation of the forts at Natchez and Nogales (Walnut
Hills) in Jan., 1798.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-15" id="Footnote_IIP-15" href="#FNanchor_IIP-15"><span class="label">[II'-15]</span></a> Mapula or vicinity&mdash;perhaps on the spot noted in Wislizenus' itinerary of
Doniphan's vanguard, Apr. 25th, 1847, Mem. p. 62: "They made on that
day but 14 miles, and encamped at Coursier's hacienda, near Mapula. This
place is to the right of the usual road, and about five miles out of the way, but
has to be resorted to for want of water, if one does not intend to go in one
trip as far as Bachimba, the nearest watering place on the road, and 32 miles
from Chihuahua." Mapula is marked on modern maps as on the railroad, S. E.
from Chihuahua, while a Fresno appears to the right, due S. from that city.
Pike is to follow the present railroad for many miles, but more or less inexactly.
His "small ridge of mountains" is passed about 4 m. S. of Chihuahua; this is
a range of hills which encompass the city on that side, and command a fine
view. On crossing them, the main road runs S. E. in a valley 10 m.
wide, bounded E. and W. by mountain ridges, with Coursier's hacienda and
Mapula off to the right. About 20 m. from Chihuahua these ridges hem the
valley so closely as to form a cañon 5 or 6 m. long and 1 m. or less wide; Wislizenus
notes a spring and ranche in this cañon; [qu.: now called Horcasitas?]
Bachimba is in the plain, about 5 m. off the cañon, on a fine running stream;
in 1847 it was a hacienda with a dozen houses.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-16" id="Footnote_IIP-16" href="#FNanchor_IIP-16"><span class="label">[II'-16]</span></a> Pike marks the fort "P[residio] de S<sup>n.</sup> Paubla," and the river "Rio
S<sup>n</sup> Paubla," without prejudice to the gender of the holy person concerned.
Modern Ortiz is about the site of the Presidio San Pablo, on the railroad, on
the N. or left bank of the river; the latter is present Rio San Pedro, a large
branch of the Conchos which falls in above Julimes. About 10 m. S. of
Bachimba the road forked; the right-hand fork went S. S. E., to Santa Cruz
de Rosales, which was said to contain 5,000 inhabitants in itself and vicinity in
1847; it is on the Rio San Pedro, 8 m. higher up than San Pablo, to which
the left-hand road leads S. E. The latter is the one Pike took; it is shorter
than the other; both come together before Saucillo is reached. In 1847 San
Pablo was reported to be "a flourishing place, with about 4,000 inhabitants":
Wislizenus, Mem. p. 63. Rio San Pedro is a fine stream, over 100 m. long, heading
in the mountains on the W. The plain or valley which it traverses, and in
which both the roads above mentioned lie, has a varying width of 25-35 m.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-17" id="Footnote_IIP-17" href="#FNanchor_IIP-17"><span class="label">[II'-17]</span></a> Pike struck Rio Conchos where the railroad does now&mdash;at Saucillo, or El
Saucillo, a town on the left or W. bank of the river; the "24 miles" from San
Pablo to this place is about right. This march was through the same valley as
yesterday's, with a good but not such a level road, as the mountains approach each
other near Saucillo, leaving S. of it a gap through which the road continues into
the next valley. The night's small station is less easily identified, but was no
doubt at Las Garzas or in that immediate vicinity, where the Conchos is crossed.
A Mexican league is supposed to be 5,000 varas (of about 33 inches each = about
4,583 yards, or nearly 2&#8532; m.), but in itineraries is usually found to be less than
this. Las Garzas (Sp. <i>garzas</i>, "herons") is an obscure place not to be found
on many modern maps; it is beyond Concho and La Cruz (both of which are
points on the railroad). Wislizenus notes it on his journey, Mem. p. 64: "We
passed through la Cruz, a small town, and further below [further S., but higher
up Rio Conchos], through las Garzas, a smaller place yet, where we crossed the
Conchos." It is the place marked "Pres[idio]" on Pike's map, which is probably
in error in marking the trail as continuing up the left bank of the Conchos.</p>

<p class="footnote">Rio Conchos is the principal river of Chihuahua, over 400 m. long, and with
its many tributaries watering much of the State. The name is said to be derived
from its shells (Sp. <i>conchas</i>), and I have seen Shell r. in print. It makes
a long loop southward before turning N., and then runs about N. E. into the
Rio Grande at Presidio del Norte&mdash;a place also called Presidio de las Juntas
(lettered "Santas" on Pike's map) from the confluence of the two rivers. Rios
Florido and San Pedro are its principal tributaries. Pike lays down the Conchos
pretty well: notice particularly its northward course on the W. of the mountains,
along what is called on his map "Puerta de la Virgin."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-18" id="Footnote_IIP-18" href="#FNanchor_IIP-18"><span class="label">[II'-18]</span></a> Pike's route of May 1st probably crossed the Conchos at or near Las Garzas,
and continued approximately up the right or E. bank of that river to the confluence
of Rio Florido, opp. Santa Rosalia, the "poor miserable village" of the
text, which stood on a hill in the point between the two rivers; its present
name is the same; the railroad passes it now. Writing of Apr. 30th, 1847,
Wislizenus has, Mem. p. 65: "Santa Rosalia is a town of about 5,000 inhabitants;
it lies on a hill about 100 feet higher than the river, and towards the S.
spreading out on a small plateau. Here, on the southern end of the town, the
Mexicans had erected a fort against General Wool, when his division was expected
to march towards Chihuahua." The town is not marked on Pike's map,
which, moreover, gives his trail as crossing the Conchos there and the Florido
higher up, though the usual road comes up the right bank of the Conchos and
crosses the Florido at or near the mouth of the latter, to continue E. S. E. up its
left side. Rio Florido is the largest branch of the Conchos, having itself various
tributaries, as R. de Barral, falling in near Bustamente, and R. Allende, with
Jimenez near its mouth; the railroad crosses both of these at the places said.
Neither of these streams appears on Pike's map. The place where he dined
seems to be about that marked Santa Rita on his map. This I do not recognize;
but it cannot have been far from Bustamente. The evident confusion of
distances in the text makes it probably impossible to identify the "private
house" at which he slept. La Ramada was a small place on the Rio Florido,
about 24 m. from Santa Rosalia. He seems to have come beyond this point,
perhaps to the vicinity of present Jimenez (on the railroad). His legend
"Camion de Monaseo" presumably stands for Camino de Monasterio (Monastery
road).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-19" id="Footnote_IIP-19" href="#FNanchor_IIP-19"><span class="label">[II'-19]</span></a> Or Guajuquilla: a well-known place on the right or S. bank of the river,
marked on Pike's map as a presidio or fortified town. A citation from Wislizenus,
Mem. p. 65, will throw some further light on the situation: "Made a
strong march to-day [May 3d, 1847] of 33 miles [from La Ramada], to <i>Guajuquilla</i>.
The road was constantly winding itself through endless chaparrál; the
Rio Florido on the left, and mountains and hills east and west, in the distance,
from 10 to 20 miles. About half way we passed a rancho with some water;
farther on the road forks; the right hand road leads directly to the town; the
other by a large hacienda [qu.: where Pike slept last night?]. Before Guajuquilla
we crossed the Florido, and passing through town encamped south of it.
Guajuquilla looks more like a town than any other place we have seen so far, on
the road from Chihuahua; its population is from 6 to 7,000." Three miles S.
of this town was the Hacienda de Dolores, "a large estate with well irrigated
and cultivated fields"; a place on the railroad is now marked "Dolores."
Thence the road continued for a jornada of about 50 m. without water. Pike
will proceed upon this on the 6th, the party having been sent ahead on the 5th.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-20" id="Footnote_IIP-20" href="#FNanchor_IIP-20"><span class="label">[II'-20]</span></a> An unidentifiable place on the jornada, short of the first water from
Guajuquilla.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-21" id="Footnote_IIP-21" href="#FNanchor_IIP-21"><span class="label">[II'-21]</span></a> Pike's map marks the first spring on the road as "Ojo S. Bernarde" and
the next as "Ojo S Blas"&mdash;names which appear to be transposed from the
order in which they come in other itineraries of this route. Thus Wislizenus,
Mem. p. 66: "About eight miles from our to-night camp, we passed a spring,
with a water-pool, in a ravine to the left of our road; but the water was so
muddy and brackish, that the animals refused to drink, or rather to eat it.
This spot is known as <i>San Antonio camp</i>. Three miles further, a few deserted
houses, and a spring on the right hand of the road (<i>San Blas</i>), are found; but
the water is equally bad, and of sulphureted taste. The first good water, and
in sufficient quantity, is met about five miles beyond San Blas, in <i>San Bernardo</i>,
a deserted rancho, with willows and cotton trees, built against a steep mountain
wall, from whence a fine creek takes its origin. A small plain half a mile below
the rancho contains also some springs and water-pools, and good grass. We
pitched our camp in this plain. We have travelled to-day, according to my estimate,
about 40 miles [<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, from a dry camp about 20 m. from the Hacienda
de Dolores, near Guajuquilla]." It is clear that Wislizenus is on Pike's trail,
and that they have reached what is practically the same camp&mdash;near the San
Bernardo spring of the former's narrative, or the San Blas spring of the latter's
map; and that the spring which Pike speaks of as the "first water from
Guaxequillo" and maps as San Bernarde spring, was either the San Antonio
camp or the San Blas spring of Wislizenus. The situation is considerably off
the present railroad, and the above names are not to be found on ordinary
modern maps. But my identifications are confirmed by the fact that both
travelers, on decamping next day, cross a mountain gap or pass and soon come
upon a river: see <a href="#Footnote_IIP-22">next note</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-22" id="Footnote_IIP-22" href="#FNanchor_IIP-22"><span class="label">[II'-22]</span></a> The mountain Pike passes, and the river he crosses, are easily identified;
the latter is the stream known as El Andabazo (or Cerro Gordo), with a town of
the latter name higher up on it. This is the first of several streams we shall
cross, running to the left as we go, and sinking in the Bolson de Mapimi&mdash;for
they are all beyond the Conchos basin, the divide of which was passed in the
course of the long dry jornada above noted. The lake that the Cerro Gordo
cr. sinks in is sometimes called Laguna de Xacco: so Hughes, Don. Exp., 1847,
p. 129. The trail Pike followed is thus described by Wislizenus, p. 66: "We
started late, and made but 10 miles, to the <i>Cerro Gordo</i>, or <i>el Andabazo</i> creek.
Having crossed the mountain, at whose foot San Bernardo lies, we went for
a mile through a cañon, with mountains of limestone on both sides, and from
there into another valley, watered by the el Andabazo. This considerable
creek seems to run from southwest to northeast." The obscure town of Cerro
Gordo above named must not be confounded with the place in Vera Cruz which
was the scene of the famous battle of Cerro Gordo.</p>

<p class="footnote">Pike has now passed the present interstate boundary between Chihuahua and
Durango. The line runs on a parallel of latitude from Lago de Tlahualila 60
Mex. leagues W. to a source of Rio del Fuerte near Huenote. Pike maps
Lake Tlahualila conspicuously: see the large sheet of water laid down in the
Bolson Mapimi across which is legended "Here the Indians sallied forth to
attack New Biscay and Cohuahuila," and which has a large forked stream running
into it from the S. The main fork of this is the present Rio de Nasas,
which actually discharges into Laguna del Muerto; so Pike's body of water
represents both Lake Tlahualila and the Lake of the Dead, as well as
some smaller sheets, as Laguna del Cayman, etc., all lying in the same general
depression. Pike mentions "Lac du Cayman" elsewhere and correctly says
that Rio Nassas (which he also calls Brassos) falls into it. L. de Parras, however,
he lays down separately, with its own river discharging into it. The
boundaries of Chihuahua, Durango, and Coahuila all meet in Lake Tlahualila,
whence that between Durango and Coahuila runs S. for a few miles and then
S. E., while that between Chihuahua and Coahuila extends N. along the border
of the Bolson to the Rio Grande.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-23" id="Footnote_IIP-23" href="#FNanchor_IIP-23"><span class="label">[II'-23]</span></a> Pelayo is the best-known place we have come to since leaving Guajuquilla,
and easily found on modern maps by this name; it appears on Pike's map as
"P[residio]. Pelia," and has been more fully called Hacienda de San José de
Pelayo. The name is thus a personal one, though some have derived it from
Sp. <i>pelar</i>, to boil, scald, with reference to the hot sulphur springs. (One
Pelayo, Latinized Pelagius, founded the monarchy of Asturias in Spain early
in the eighth century <span class="s08">A. D.</span> The form Palayo is also found.) The place is on
the main road, about 25 m. from the crossing of Andabazo cr. "Pelayo,"
says Wislizenus, p. 67, "is a small village, or hacienda, with several good
springs around it; some of common, others of higher temperature. The creek
formed by them is, according to the Mexican statements, afterwards lost in
the sand.... In Pelayo, a small but steep hill was fortified on the top, by walls
of stone. This fortification was probably intended against General Wool's
army. Two days before us [<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, May 5th, 1847] Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell
had arrived here with the vanguard [of Doniphan's troops], and seeing the
inhabitants of the place organized as a military company, he made 30 of them
prisoners, and took their arms from them; but upon their representation that
they would by this act become a prey to the surrounding Indians, he restored
them their arms, under the condition that they be used only for defence
against Indians." That series of creeks flowing to the left, two of which have
thus far been mentioned, are all crossed by the railroad, much E. of Pike's
route; four places at or near which such crossings occur are named Escalon,
Zavalza, Conejos, and Peronal&mdash;the two former in Chihuahua, the two latter in
Durango, and the last of these being nearest the railroad crossing of the creek
which flows through La Cadena, as about to be noted.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-24" id="Footnote_IIP-24" href="#FNanchor_IIP-24"><span class="label">[II'-24]</span></a> La Cadena is present name of a place on or near the fourth one of the small
streams above noted, considerably off (?) the modern main road&mdash;say 20 m.
S. W. of Peronal, and 25 m. due W. of Mapimi. It is reached by a rough
mountain road 18 m. from Pelayo, past the copper mine of Oruilla; the
hacienda there, of which Pike speaks as being so rich in stock, had been
deserted when Wislizenus passed in 1847. The creek comes from the Sierra
de las Mimbres, on the W. Another steep range rises about 3 m. E. of La
Cadena; the gap between the two is the Pass of Cadena, Puerta de Cadena, or
"Door of the Prison," through which Pike goes to-day due E. in the direction
of Mapimi.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-25" id="Footnote_IIP-25" href="#FNanchor_IIP-25"><span class="label">[II'-25]</span></a> Lettered "Maupeme" on the map, and so rendered in the text beyond;
same word as that in Pike's legend "Bolson de Mapini"; now usually spelled
Mapimi. Hughes writes Malpimi. The meaning of the word is unknown, as
it probably would not be were it of Spanish derivation; its most frequent use is
in the phrase Bolson de Mapimi, applied to very extensive tracts of low-lying
ground encompassed with mountains, chiefly in the states of Chihuahua and
Coahuila, but also overreaching into Durango. <i>Bolson</i> is a Spanish word which
means various things, among them "purse," "pouch," or "pocket," and seems
to be applied here in the same way that we use the word "hole" for several different
valleys in our Rocky mts. Mapimi, as the designation of a particular
place, is still the name of the town Pike comes to, now on the railroad, about
15 m. by rail from Peronal, and about 20 m. by the road he came from La
Cadena Pass. It is thus the place where the highway and the railroad come
together. The situation is the eastern part of an extensive valley some 20 m.
wide and 35 m. long from N. to S., surrounded on all sides by mountains yielding
silver mines. "Two springs, called Espiritu Santo and Agua de Leon,
form here [at Mapimi] a creek, which runs through the town in an eastern
direction," Wislizenus, <i>l. c.</i> This seems to be the stream that "formed a terrestrial
paradise" for Pike&mdash;as well it might, with the Holy Ghost re-enforcing
Ponce de Leon. Wislizenus found Mapimi "rather deserted," May 9th, 1847;
but the artillery "fired a salute, in honor of the anniversary of the battle of
Palo Alto" (fought May 8th, 1846). Pike's camp of the 11th of May, 3 m. E.
of Mapimi, was snug under the eastern mountain chain, whence it was about
2 m. through a cañon into another valley forming a part of the series of the
Bolson de Mapimi.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-26" id="Footnote_IIP-26" href="#FNanchor_IIP-26"><span class="label">[II'-26]</span></a> "The little village" is not named. Pike's map makes the triple forking
of the road he is about to mention in the immediate vicinity of Mapimi; but
this appears to be an error, as he was already 3 m. beyond that town when he
started on the 12th. His map is otherwise so far out of drawing that it does
help us much more than the slender thread of text to discover exactly what
way Captain Barelo took him around the Bolson to Parras. The precise stages
of the journey to Parras would probably be recoverable by one thoroughly
familiar with the ground; but it is impossible for me to trace the route upon any
map I have been able to find. The only road laid down on the best map before
me runs down the Rio Nasas past San Lorenzo to Mayron, at the Laguna del
Muerto, into which that river sinks, and thence to Pozo (Pozzo) and Parras.
From the railroad junction at Torreon the track runs at a distance from, but
approximately parallel with, the river and the road just indicated, through places
marked Matamoras, Colonia, and Hornos, to Mayron and thence to Pozo.
Wislizenus speaks of a place apparently about where Pike comes to on the 12th,
where the road forks, and describes a "northern" and a "southern" route.
The northern one, he says, leads by Alamito, San Lorenzo, and San Juan (all
on the Rio Nasas) to El Pozo; it is thus identical with or very nearly the same
as the one just said to descend the Rio Nasas. The southern one, he says,
would have taken him by San Sebastian, on the Nasas, to Gatuño, Matamoras
(or la Bega de Maraujo), Santa Mayara, by the Laguna de Parras to Alamo de
Parras, St. Domingo, and Peña, to El Pozo, and thence to Parras. I think
that Pike's route coincides most closely with this one; it is for the most part
S. of the railroad, passing close to the Laguna de Parras (the sink of the
Rio Guanabel); and when we find him at Parras, on the 17th, he is almost due
E. of the place where he crossed the Rio Nasas, at an air-line distance therefrom
of nearly or about 40 Mexican leagues&mdash;say 100 m.</p>

<p class="footnote">The "Monsieur de Croix" above named is Teodoro de Croix, b. at Lille,
Flanders, about 1730, d. at Madrid, Spain, Apr. 8th, 1791; he was viceroy of
Peru from Apr., 1784, to Mar., 1790; he had previously served as commandant
of the interior provinces and of Sonora, under his elder brother, Carlos
Francisco de Croix, Marques de Croix, and viceroy of New Spain, 1766-1771.
See the legend of his route on Pike's map.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-27" id="Footnote_IIP-27" href="#FNanchor_IIP-27"><span class="label">[II'-27]</span></a> "Brasses" and "Brassos" are Pike's rendering of Brazos, name of a great
river in Texas, but the stream here meant by "Brasses" is Rio Nasas (or
Nazas), which flows into Laguna del Muerto, in Coahuila. This he elsewhere
calls Nassas and Nassus; saying that it runs into Lake Cayman, and
forms part of the boundary between Cogquilla (Coahuila) and New Biscay (his
name for Chihuahua, though he means Durango). He also charts it conspicuously,
but much out of drawing: see his map, first river E. of Mapimi, with
"Rancho S<sup>n</sup> Antonio" there lettered. Some of my maps, running back 40 years,
apply the name Nazas to that other stream (Rio Guanabal) which sinks in
Laguna de Parras, and which Pike also charts, greatly out of position; but he
is correct in his identification of the Nasas. This is a notable stream in Durango
and Coahuila, which has been called "the vein and center of the Bolson" by
Wislizenus, who says further, p. 69: "San Sebastian is a hacienda on the left
bank of the Nasas river, and about 35 miles from Mapimi. The Nasas is here
quite a deep and respectable stream, while further down it becomes flat, and
disappears sometimes entirely in the sand. It comes about 150 leagues from the
western part of the State of Durango, from the so-called Sianori mountains....
The Nasas is the Nile of the Bolson de Mapimi; the wide and level country
along the river is yearly inundated by its rising, and owes to that circumstance
its great fertility."</p>

<p class="footnote">On crossing Rio Nasas, or at a point on his road in that vicinity, Pike
passes from the present State of Durango into that of Coahuila; but we have no
mileage for the 13th. He never leaves Coahuila till he enters the Texas of his
day, close to present San Antonio de Bexar, Tex. He never touches Nuevo
Leon at any point.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-28" id="Footnote_IIP-28" href="#FNanchor_IIP-28"><span class="label">[II'-28]</span></a> El Rancho de San Antonio, already indicated as on the Rio Nasas, but
exact location in question. I cannot find the name on any modern map. It
does not seem to be the same place as the San Sebastian mentioned by Wislizenus.
But the general locality is near the present interstate boundary of
Coahuila and Durango, not far from the place where the two railroads cross
each other, known as El Torreon (The Tower).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-29" id="Footnote_IIP-29" href="#FNanchor_IIP-29"><span class="label">[II'-29]</span></a> Santa Rosa, one of the principal Coahuilan towns, about half-way between
Monclova and Presidio del Rio Grande, on waters of the Upper Rio Sabinas,
and on the road which General Wool took during the invasion of Mexico.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-30" id="Footnote_IIP-30" href="#FNanchor_IIP-30"><span class="label">[II'-30]</span></a> See Pike's map, place legended "Well of Putrid Water."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-31" id="Footnote_IIP-31" href="#FNanchor_IIP-31"><span class="label">[II'-31]</span></a> The text is contradictory concerning mileage, and ambiguous in the matter of
the road which came in. The place whence water was drawn is that legended
"Well of Mineral Water" on Pike's map. I am not sure that this is El Pozo
of various maps and itineraries before me, called "Pozzo" on the most modern
ones; but am inclined to think it is. Pozo is a well-known place where the
railroad now crosses a highway, and whence there is a regular road S. W. to
Alamos de Parras, and another S. E. to Parras itself. Under date of May 13th,
1847, Wislizenus has, Mem. p. 71: "We travelled to-day 25 miles from San
Juan to <i>el Pozo</i>. The road was more gravelly than sandy, at first quite level,
afterwards slightly ascending. A few miles to our right a steep mountain chain
was running parallel with our road; to the left rose more distant mountains....
About half way we passed by a deserted rancho, 'Refugio,' with a well.
Near El Pozo the valley becomes narrower." Dr. W. describes a fight with
Lipan Indians which had occurred at Pozo two days before, and continues, p.
72: "<i>El Pozo</i> (the well) is a hacienda, belonging to Don Manuel de Ibarra,
and consists of but one large building, in which many families live. The place
is distinguished for its ingenious water-works. It consists of a deep and very
spacious well, from which the water is drawn by mule power in the following
way: Over a large wheel in the upper part of the well a strong and broad band
of leather is stretched, moving around with the wheel; to the band, in regular
distances, many buckets of leather are attached, which, by the equal circular
motion of the wheel and the band, are descending on one side of the well, and
fill themselves with water, while they are drawn up on the other side, and, emptying
their water into a basin, return again to the well. To receive the drawn
water, two large basins of stone, about 40 feet wide and 100 feet long, have been
made, and on the outside of the basins runs a long line of troughs, all of stone,
for the watering of the animals.... The same Indians which our men fought
here, the Lipans, used to frequent this well very freely, and carried their impudence
even so far that they notified the Mexicans at what time they wanted to
have the basins full, and the Mexicans did not dare to disobey. Although the
idea of this water-wheel is by no means a new one, it is certainly very simply
and well executed, and the more gratifying to the traveller, as this is the only
watering place between San Juan and Parras, a distance of about 50 miles."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-32" id="Footnote_IIP-32" href="#FNanchor_IIP-32"><span class="label">[II'-32]</span></a> No mileage for the 17th; but Paras is a notable place, easily discovered on
ordinary maps. Sp. <i>parras</i> means grapevines, especially such as are
trained on a trellis, and various vineyards have given geographical names in
Mexico, as Laguna de Parras, Alamo de Parras, etc. The latter is a phrase
coming near what is meant by our traditional "vine and fig-tree"; it now designates
a place further W., not to be mistaken for Parras itself. "Paras" and
the San Lorenzo hacienda above said are both marked on Pike's map; the latter
must not be confused with present town of San Lorenzo on Rio Nasas, much
further W. The map is entirely out of drawing in these parts, but not irrecognizably,
and we can make the requisite adjustments. In particular, Laguna de
Parras is put down over 100 m. from its true position, and the course of its
feeder (Rio Guanabal) is still further out of the way. His route passed near
this laguna, between it and Laguna del Muerto. We must not forget that he
was traveling under compulsion, propulsion, and perpetual irritation&mdash;circumstances
unfavorable to the accuracy of such notes as he could take by stealth
and afterward supplement from memory, and under which he could not be
expected to improve Humboldt's map!</p>

<p class="footnote">Some extracts from Dr. Wislizenus, Mem. pp. 72, 73, will give a better idea
of Parras than Pike's glimpse affords: "<i>May 14</i> [1847]. We left [Pozo] this
morning for <i>Parras</i>, in the State of Coahuila.... Our road ran parallel with
a near mountain chain on the right, and was mostly ascending. In the latter
part of our march we saw from a hill Parras, at the foot of the same chain,
which here makes a bend towards southeast. The first sight of the town
reminded me of el Paso, on account of the great many gardens and vineyards
that surround it. Entering the town, I was struck with the luxuriant growth of
pomegranates, figs, and fruits of all sorts, and with the enormous height and
circumference of the common opuntias and agaves, which I had already seen in
the State of Chihuahua, but much smaller. The opuntias had trunks of one foot
in diameter, and the agave americana grew to the height of from 10 to 15 feet,
making excellent hedges. The town itself was much handsomer than I had expected.
It has some fine streets, with old substantial buildings, a large 'plaza,'
and a general appearance of wealth and comfort. We encamped in the Alameda,
a beautiful public walk, shaded with cotton trees and provided with seats
of repose. Early in the morning a concert of thousands of birds, many mockingbirds
among them, that live here quite undisturbed, awoke us from our
slumber. These Alamedas, fashionable in all the Mexican cities, do honor to
the general taste of the Mexicans for flowers, gardens, and natural embellishments.
To prevent any injury to the trees our horses were kept outside the
Alameda. Parras was probably built towards the end of the seventeenth century,
and received its name from its vine, parra meaning vine-branch. The cultivation
of the vine is at present a principal object of industry in Parras. The
vineyards are mostly on the hilly slopes of the limestone mountains west of town.
They produce a white and a red wine, both of very pleasant taste, resembling
somewhat the wine of el Paso, but more heating and stronger.... We rested
in Parras two days, and left it on the morning of <i>May 17</i>, on our road to Saltillo.
From Parras we marched about five miles in an eastern direction, through a
a plain, to <i>San Lorenzo</i>, or, as it is commonly called, <i>Hacienda de Abajo</i>, a
large, splendid hacienda, belonging to the above mentioned Don Manuel de
Ibarra. The road from el Pozo leads directly to this place; by going to Parras,
several leagues are lost." This "lower hacienda" is the one which Pike names
above, and where he camps to-night.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-33" id="Footnote_IIP-33" href="#FNanchor_IIP-33"><span class="label">[II'-33]</span></a> No distance or direction given, and no place named&mdash;but we can discover
Pike by extraneous means. Dr. Wislizenus says, p. 73: "From here [San
Lorenzo] the road was winding over a hilly and rocky country, till we arrived in
<i>Cienega Grande</i>, a hacienda of Don Rey de Guerrero, (25 miles from Parras.)"
This is no doubt the place Pike reaches, on his way to Patos. The unnamed
hacienda of the text is so marked on his map, on the above "fine stream."
This creek requires attention. Pike lays it down as one of the headwaters of
Rio Tigre, also called Rio San Francisco del Tigre, which he mistakes it to be,
and so runs it off into the Gulf of Mexico, about where Tiger r. does in fact
empty. But Pike was never on any tributary of Tiger r.&mdash;never in that watershed
at all&mdash;never in Nuevo Leon. His "fine stream" is a headwater of that
river which falls into the Rio Grande by Ringgold Barracks, and whose two
main forks are known as Rio San Juan and Rio Salinas. Saltillo, once known
as Leona Victoria, and present capital of Coahuila, is on a branch of the Salinas
(Rio Meteros); and Monterey, present capital of Nuevo Leon, is on a branch of
the San Juan.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-34" id="Footnote_IIP-34" href="#FNanchor_IIP-34"><span class="label">[II'-34]</span></a> Before coming to Patos and Florida, we will see what Wislizenus says, Mem.
p. 73: "<i>May 18.</i> Through a wide valley, with mountains to the north and
south, we went to-day (18 miles) to <i>Rancho Nuevo</i>, and encamped about one
mile southeast of it, in a valley.... Some miles from our camp, in a corner,
amidst mountains, lies <i>Castañuela</i>, an old but small town, from which a shorter
but very rough road leads over the mountains to Parras. A fine creek runs by
it, descending from the southwest mountains and turning towards the northeast."
This seems to be about the place to which Pike was brought on the 19th.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-35" id="Footnote_IIP-35" href="#FNanchor_IIP-35"><span class="label">[II'-35]</span></a> "Pattos" is marked "Hacienda Poloss" on Pike's map, where it is set down
about a day's journey due W. of "Saltello"; "Florida" is also marked, nearly
as far off to the N. E. But these are mere crudities of engraving; any good
modern map will show Patos, about 35 m. W. by S. from Saltillo, and about 16
m. S. by W. from San Antonio de Jaral; which latter is 12 m. S. E. of a place
on the railroad now called Pastora. As to Patos and its vicinity we will hear
from Dr. Wislizenus, Mem. p. 74: "<i>May 19.</i> Marched 25 miles [from Rancho
Nuevo] to <i>Vequeria</i>, a small place on a creek of the same name. The very
tortuous road led over a hilly and broken country. From one of the hills we
perceived, towards the E. N. E., the distant mountains of Saltillo. About five
miles from Vequeria we passed a creek with very clear water, the San Antonio,
which unites below, near <i>Patos</i>, with the Vequeria creek.... Northeast from
Vequeria is an opening in the surrounding mountains, through which the mountain
chain of Saltillo appears again. The route through this pass is the shortest
and most direct from Saltillo, but with wagons one has to take a southeastern
course to avoid the mountains. About one mile from Vequeria, in the pass
leading to Saltillo, lies <i>Patos</i>, a small town." The name of the place Dr. W.
calls "Vequeria" is preferably spelled Vaqueria; the word means simply stock-farm
or cattle-ranch; vaqueros are the cowboys of such places, whom I used to
hear called "buckeros" when I was in New Mexico, perhaps by unconscious
confusing of "vaqueros" with the bucking bronchos they rode.</p>

<p class="footnote">Here we regret to take leave of our accomplished fellow-traveler, who has
set up finger-posts on Pike's route all the way from El Paso to Patos. Dr. Wislizenus
keeps on eastward to meet General Wool's forces at Buena Vista and
Saltillo. Pike has turned northward, down the San Antonio cr., and camps at
Florida, less than 3 m. N. of Patos, in the direction of San Antonio de Jaral.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-36" id="Footnote_IIP-36" href="#FNanchor_IIP-36"><span class="label">[II'-36]</span></a> Route of the 21st northward, past if not through San Antonio de Jaral,
down the right side of San Antonio cr., and across this from E. to W.; thence
continuing northward to some point probably on the present railroad and in the
vicinity of the station now known as Sauceda (Willows). Pike's map shows
the crossing, at a point below certain forks he delineates, probably not far from
half-way between Sauceda and Pastora.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-37" id="Footnote_IIP-37" href="#FNanchor_IIP-37"><span class="label">[II'-37]</span></a> Route N., thus bearing off from the river, main road, and line of present
railroad, all of which run along together about N. N. E.; camp at or near no
named place, but about 8 m. due W. of a place on the railroad (Treviño or
Venadito) where a branch turns off to go to Monterey. "La Rancho" of
the text, better written El Rancho, or simply ranch, is beyond the place
marked on the map as an Indian village by the name of "Rambo"&mdash;unless this
is the ranch itself, a little misplaced.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-38" id="Footnote_IIP-38" href="#FNanchor_IIP-38"><span class="label">[II'-38]</span></a> Route about N., 15-20 m. to the foot of the pass in the cross mountain, at
the place marked "Rivera" on Pike's map.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-39" id="Footnote_IIP-39" href="#FNanchor_IIP-39"><span class="label">[II'-39]</span></a> On making Three Rivers Pass in the morning, Pike goes over the "cross
mountain" which forms the divide between the waters of the San Juan and
Salinas basin, and comes upon the water-shed of Rio Sabinas (which river he
will cross to reach the Rio Grande). The main road which he strikes at the
13th mile is also the railroad line, and he strikes them both at or near Bajan,
5 m. above Joya, where the main road now comes in from points eastward.
We have no mileage for the 24th, but it was a good day's journey to get only 9
m. short of Montelovez (Monclova).</p>

<p class="footnote">As several of Pike's daily mileages are missing, we cannot say exactly how
many miles he made it out to be from the Mapimi locality to Montelovez. If
we average up the missing ones with the rest of the 14 days, it makes 15 m. a
day, or a total of 210 m. Those who are better informed than myself concerning
the kind of country passed over can judge how near right these figures may
be. It seems to me rather scant measure for the most direct route by which
the Bolson could have been flanked by anything like the curve the railroad
now takes. Pike certainly never made such a fishhook-shaped trail as that
delineated on his map, if he only went 210 m.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-40" id="Footnote_IIP-40" href="#FNanchor_IIP-40"><span class="label">[II'-40]</span></a> Route N., down E. bank of the river on which Monclova is situated, along
the main road and present railroad. No mileage; but 5½ hours on a road
should make 16-18 m., and set Pike near Hermanos, at the place Don Melcher
or Michon had his real estate.</p>

Nov. 1st, 1796, made a captain July 10th, 1797, transferred to the 2d Infantry

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-42" id="Footnote_IIP-42" href="#FNanchor_IIP-42"><span class="label">[II'-42]</span></a> The present town of Encinas (The Oaks) is on the road, 20 m. from Hermanos,
and presumably at or near the site of the old Barego estate. Pike is
fairly in the valley of Rio Sabinas.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-43" id="Footnote_IIP-43" href="#FNanchor_IIP-43"><span class="label">[II'-43]</span></a> Millada r. of Pike is the main fork of Sabinas r., and the one whose upper
waters he left at Hermanos. Leaving it there, the road through Encinas to
Alamo cuts off a bend of the river which the railroad now meanders by way of
Baroteran, Aura, Obeya, and so on. The ranch was at present site of Alamo,
a well-known crossing where several roads still concenter, 10 or 12 m. above
the forks. It used to be called Alameda Arriba or, as we should say, "Upper
Cottonwoods"; whence I imagine that Pike got his name "Millada." This
river flowed to his right as he faced N.; the letter "w" of the word "which"
is engraved on the map at precisely the point he crossed this stream: see <a href="#Footnote_IIP-44">next
note</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-44" id="Footnote_IIP-44" href="#FNanchor_IIP-44"><span class="label">[II'-44]</span></a> The main stream of Sabinas r. is crossed at the place now called Potrillo,
and also Juarez, 10 m. from Alamo. This sets Pike at a point 17 m. further on
a bee line for the Presidio Grande. His mapping of the "Millada" and
Sabinas rivers is faulty to the last degree: see the map on this point. 1. The
Millada (on which the letter "w" is engraved) should turn above that point and
connect with the stream on which "Montelovez" is situated. 2. The main
Sabinas (identifiable on the map by "&#9651; Kan" engraved alongside Pike's trail)
should have been carried clear up N. W., 100 m. or more. 3. The great river
which Pike fetches into the Rio Grande at Presidio Grande, and which he runs
down to this point from "Montelovez," does not exist. It is an imaginary
river, compounded of about equal parts of upper portions of the two forks of
the Sabinas, cut off from their proper connections lower down, and run into the
Rio Grande about 100 m. too high up. The rest of the river (E. of Pike's trail)
is connected with the Rio Grande about right&mdash;that is to say, below Laredo.
Observe that Pike says nothing about crossing the mouth of any such river as
his map shows just where his trail comes to the Rio Grande. It is a sheer
blunder, which has baffled many a person who naturally supposed that Pike
fetched up at the mouth of Sabinas r., some 40 m. below Laredo, but never
could see how he got there, or how he got thence to San Antonio, or what in the
name of geography the two rivers he crossed were anyhow. In fine, this affair
of the Sabinas r. befogged the whole trail for several hundred miles, both in
Mexico and in Texas. For my own part, I first tried to bring Pike to the Rio
Grande at the mouth of Sabinas r., and very soon lost him in Nuevo Leon&mdash;to
say nothing of the impossibility of trailing him thence to San Antonio. Then
I tried the roads to Laredo, observing that this would do pretty well for the
Texan side; but again I lost him in Nuevo Leon. Though the map itself
indicated that Pike never was in Nuevo Leon (where General Salcedo, in fact,
had no business to send troops, as it was out of his jurisdiction), yet political
boundaries nearly a century old go for little on their face, and I was almost
tempted to give the puzzle up. But I thought that I would try the experiment
of disregarding the map altogether, and trailing Pike solely by his itinerary in the
text. It was a week's work to satisfy myself that he was never over the present
boundary of Coahuila after he left Durango, and probably never 25 m. on either
side of the railroad from Mapimi to Sabinas r. There he was within two days
of the Rio Grande, heading straight for the Presidio Salto; and a glance at his
map showed me what the trouble was with that unlucky river.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIP-45" id="Footnote_IIP-45" href="#FNanchor_IIP-45"><span class="label">[II'-45]</span></a> Directly on the main road to Presidio Salto&mdash;the Presidio Grande, or del
Rio Grande, of Pike. The running water, on which was situated a ranch,
was one of the several <i>small</i> affluents of the Rio Grande which run E. along
here on the Mexican side.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIIP-1" id="Footnote_IIIP-1" href="#FNanchor_IIIP-1"><span class="label">[III'-1]</span></a> Pike is now seen to have been all the while on the old Spanish trail from
Coahuila into Texas&mdash;for it was the "old" trail of his day, a century ago.
The place is 40 m. below Eagle Pass or old Fort Duncan, and 90 m. above
Laredo or old Fort McIntosh. It is thus the middle one of three places on the
river within easy striking distance of San Antonio, Tex. From each of the three
roads still converge to the latter point; but this most historic place on the lower
Rio Grande has in the course of time fallen between two stools, so to speak.
For now one railroad runs from San Antonio nearly S. to Laredo, by the way
of Pearsall, Derby, Cotulla, Encinal, Webb, and Sanchez, and another comes
W. to Laredo from Corpus Christi on the Gulf; while a third railroad connects
San Antonio with Eagle Pass by way of Castroville, Salinal, and Brackettville
(Fort Clark). The last named one is that which Pike kept so close to on his
way out of Mexico; the one from Laredo runs in Nuevo Leon to Monterey and
so on. Eagle Pass is roundly 500 m. up the Rio Grande, by any practicable road,
but less than half as far from the Gulf in a direct line. Forty years ago it had
a population of 300, and Fort Duncan, which adjoined the town, was our uppermost
military post on the river. On the other side the Mexicans had their
similar establishment at a place called Piedras Negras or Black Rocks. A fine
view of this place is given on one of the engravings of the U. S. and Mex. B.
Survey, supposed to be bound opp. p. 72. The Ciudad Porfirio Diaz is there or
thereabouts now, and another settlement called Fuentes is in the neighborhood;
but Fort Duncan has disappeared, except from history. Fuentes is on a small
river which falls in just above; higher up on the same is San Fernando de
Rosas, or Zaragoza, a point whence various roads radiate. Laredo or Loredo
is a very old place, whose history dates back to the early Spanish occupation of
the country. Emory writes that in his time, say 1850, it was a decayed place of
600 inhabitants, having been ravaged by savage hordes, and being then supported
mainly by old Fort McIntosh, which was built a mile above the town. He
thinks that the countless herds of horses which had been stampeded and stolen
by the Indians were the progenitors of the mustangs which roamed the plains of
Texas thence N. and E. Laredo is now a focal point of roads from every
direction, including two railroads; and a place called Nuevo Laredo is established
across the river. At 61 or 62 m. by the road below Laredo, and thus opposite
the mouth of Rio Sabinas (which takes the undesirable name of Rio Salado
below its forks), a fortified trading-post was built, and called Bellville. This
name appears on maps of 40 years ago, but has lapsed, like that of Redmond's
Ranch by which it was once known, and there is nothing on the American side
to show for what would supposably be a marked place&mdash;the confluence of so
large a river with the Rio Grande. But there is a town of Carrizo a few miles
below, on the Texan side. The Mexican town of Guerro or Guerrero is located
on the N. bank of Rio Salado, 4 m. up; and 3 m. further are the handsome
falls, a colored plate of which should be found opp. p. 65 of the Report last
named. Forty miles below this confluence, Rio Alamo, also known as Rio
Alcontre, falls in on the Mexican side, and 4 m. up this river is the town of
Mier, on its S. bank. Mier, or a town of that name in this vicinity, must be
an old place; Pike marks a Mier on the Texan side. The Mier of the Mexican
War became a celebrated place, during the Texan invasion of 1840, when
a desperate fight occurred on its plaza. It was then a town of 2,000 or 3,000
inhabitants, and had many stone buildings among the straw-thatched huts. It
made much history, and was a point of strategic importance, being the starting-place
of the shortest and most direct road to Monterey. Military operations on
the Rio Grande during the American occupation of Mier are said by Emory to
have altered the channel of the river, with the result of throwing the island of
Los Adjuntos over to the Mexican side, and thus changing what had been the
United States and Mexican boundary. About 5 m. further down the Rio
Grande stands Roma, a town on the American side, notable as the head of
ordinary steamboat navigation. Below this, at the distance of 16 or 17 m., are
the adjoining localities of Rio Grande City and Ringgold Barracks. These
notable places are opposite the mouth of the San Juan r., on some of whose
headwaters Pike was found in the country W. of Saltillo, and which is the first
considerable stream that falls in on the Mexican side above the Gulf. The town
of Camargo is built on its E. bank, about 4 m. up. The original establishment
of Fort Ringgold is old (for our young history on the Rio Grande); it was
a mean place in 1850, when Rio Grande City had a population of about 300, but
came into prominence during the years of the Boundary Survey, when it was
a base of various operations, and a point of observation: distance from the sea,
241 m. by the river; alt. 521 feet; lat. 26° 22´ 27.79´´ N.; long. 98° 46´ 32.85´´
W. (Emory, <i>l. c.</i>). All the points here in mention, between and including
Ringgold Barracks and Laredo, are in Texas or in Tamaulipas; for Nuevo Leon
is cut off from the Rio Grande by the Tamaulipan "Panhandle" which runs
up to Coahuila. To return now from our trip up and down the river to the
famous place where we left Pike: The name of Presidio Rio Grande which
Pike uses is not yet entirely obsolete, but the place is now better known as
Presidio Salto&mdash;that is, "Fort Falls," or the Mexican military post which was
established near the falls of the Rio Grande. Las Isletas, or The Islets, is the
name of the place in the river where the usually impassable falls or rapids occur,
and just above these is the crossing. The scene is well shown on the plate
opp. p. 68 of the Report cited. The latitude of Las Isletas was determined by
Michler in 1853 to be 28° 16´ 11.5´´ N.</p>

vicinity of Carrizo springs, Maverick Co.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIIP-3" id="Footnote_IIIP-3" href="#FNanchor_IIIP-3"><span class="label">[III'-3]</span></a> The Nueces (R. des Noix of F. maps, as Vaugondy, 1783; Neuces on
Winterbotham's, 1795) is the first one of the large series of rivers which drain
Texas to the S. E. and S., and fall into one another or separately into the
Gulf. Among these are the San Antonio, the Guadalupe, the Colorado (Red
river of Texas), the Brazos, the Trinity, the Nechez, and the Sabine&mdash;all of
which Pike had to cross, in the order in which they are here named, to reach
Natchitoches on the Red r. in the present State of Louisiana. During this
journey to the last named he continued in what was then the Spanish province
of Coahuila until he was almost to San Antonio, and thereafter traversed
the then province of Texas, though he passed into what is now the U. S. State
of Texas on crossing the Rio Grande.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIIP-4" id="Footnote_IIIP-4" href="#FNanchor_IIIP-4"><span class="label">[III'-4]</span></a> Those three streams which Pike lays down across his trail, before the San
Antonio is reached, are the Nueces; the Leona, a branch of the Frio; and
the Frio, main branch of the Nueces. These are successively crossed in the
order here given. To-day's pond is marked on the map, between the Nueces
and the Leona; a second pond is also marked, between the Leona and the
Frio. Pike letters the Frio "Cold Creek," and runs the Nueces into the Rio
Grande at or near Mier (see <a href="#Footnote_IIIP-1">note<sup>1</sup></a>); but it empties separately into the Gulf of
Mexico near Corpus Christi. Fort Ewell was built on the Nueces, on the
road between San Antonio and Laredo (Fort McIntosh); near the headwaters
of the Leona was situated Fort Inge, on the road from San Antonio to Eagle
Pass (Fort Duncan).</p>

<p class="footnote">My maps differ irreconcilably concerning a certain Rio Quihi, tributary to the
Nueces system. The best one, of 1857-58, makes it a large branch of the
Leona, reaching across the direct route from Presidio Salto to San Antonio, and
therefore across Pike's trail. <i>This</i> Quihi r. is the present San Miguel r., which
joins the Frio in McMullen Co. On an earlier map, 1849, there is no such
river, but an insignificant Quihi cr., branch of a Rio Hondo, branch of a Rio
Seco, branch of the Rio Frio. Some of these maps lay down a branch of the
Frio called Artaceoasa cr. in one instance, and Atascosa cr. in another; this
name is the same as that of a place Pike marks "Astecostota," and of present
Atascosa Co., in which the creek runs to fall into the Frio in Live Oak Co.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIIP-5" id="Footnote_IIIP-5" href="#FNanchor_IIIP-5"><span class="label">[III'-5]</span></a> "Lee Panes" looks at first sight as if intended for Les Panis, the Pawnees.
But this is Pike's way of rendering Lipans. These were a tribe cognate with
Apaches, and therefore of Athapascan stock. They were often called Lipan
Apaches, and sometimes Sipans. Pike elsewhere speaks of "the language of
the Appaches and Le Panis," showing what he means.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIIP-6" id="Footnote_IIIP-6" href="#FNanchor_IIIP-6"><span class="label">[III'-6]</span></a> The trip from the Rio Grande to the San Antonio r. made about 151 m. by
Pike's estimates, serving to show the course of the old Spanish trail as the most
direct route then practicable. Pike's Mariano is now called Medina r.; on this
is Castroville, seat of Medina Co., and the river mostly separates this county
from Bexar Co. Pike sets San Antonio on the N. bank of an affluent of a fork
large enough to look as if it were Rio Cibolo; but this last comes in much further
down the San Antonio, and no doubt he intended simply to delineate the
small forked San Pedro, on one of whose branches the city was situated. The
San Antonio itself is represented as joining the Guadalupe high up; but these
two great rivers only come together as they approach the coast, to fall into
Espiritu Santo bay opposite Matagorda isl., between Indianola and Arkansas
City. On some old maps, as that in Winterbotham's History, 1795, San Antonio
is set on a stream called Rio Hondo, which is run separately into the Gulf of
Mexico between the Nueces and the Guadalupe. The early importance of the
Mariano or Medina r. as a political boundary ceased of course with the retirement
of Coahuila beyond the Rio Grande, and thus the extension of Texan territory,
through what had been Coahuilan territory, to New Mexico. The city
was formerly more fully called San Antonio de Bexar, Bejar, Behar, Bexer, etc.,
to distinguish it from uncounted other places dedicated to the patron saint of
highways by highwaymen and other persons, and is still the seat of Bexar Co.;
pop. lately 37,673 (scarcely less than that of Dallas). The mission of "St.
Joseph," commonly called San José, is figured on p. 69 of Major Emory's
reports, probably looking much as it did when Pike was received there by the
priest; and the steel engraving which forms the frontispiece of the same volume
shows the plaza of the city. San Antonio is a very old place, having been occupied
for military and ecclesiastical purposes before 1720, was long the most
important one in Texas, was styled Thermopylæ of Texas after the massacre of
Texans by Mexicans at Fort Alamo, Mar. 6th, 1836, and is now the second in
size, though the capital of the present State is Austin, on the Rio Colorado of
Texas.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIIP-7" id="Footnote_IIIP-7" href="#FNanchor_IIIP-7"><span class="label">[III'-7]</span></a> Sabine r. still forms a portion of the boundary between Texas and
Louisiana&mdash;that is, from the Gulf to 32° N., the remainder being along a
meridian to 33°. In consequence of its delimiting office, it was formerly
called Rio Mexicano and Mexican r. Thus "Mexicano R." appears on the map
accompanying Winterbotham's History, N. Y., J. Reid, 1795.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIIP-8" id="Footnote_IIIP-8" href="#FNanchor_IIIP-8"><span class="label">[III'-8]</span></a> Striking the Guadalupe at about the nearest point, in the vicinity of present
town of New Braunfels; to reach it, Rio Cibolo was crossed, and there was the
place called El Beson. There is no such disparity of size between the Guadalupe
and San Antonio rivers as Pike's map indicates. The former has two
main forks, the western one retaining the name Guadalupe, for which Pike
letters "Buenacus." The other is called Rio San Marco, or San Marcos; it
falls in at or near Gonzales, about 40 m. (direct) below New Braunfels.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIIP-10" id="Footnote_IIIP-10" href="#FNanchor_IIIP-10"><span class="label">[III'-10]</span></a> Camp short of Bastrop, a comparatively old place on the Rio Colorado,
located at the point where the Spanish trail crossed the river, about 35 m.
below Austin, and present seat of the county of the same name. Bastrop is a
mere village, pop. about 1,650, but the name was famous in the early annals
of Texas, when the Baron Bastrop had his immense estate on the Washita.
Dunbar and Hunter, in their well-known Observations, etc., which formed
one of the tracts accompanying Jefferson's Message to Congress of Feb. 19th,
1806, inform us that the Baron's great grant of land from the Spanish
government began near the Bayou Bartholomew, about 12 leagues above
the post on the Washita, and consisted of a square 12 leagues on each side,
or over a million French acres (London ed. 1807, p. 83). Bastrop seems to
have been a prototype of the modern "cattle barons," or "cattle kings," as
they are styled, who generally manage to cover more ground than Queen
Dido did when she stretched a bull's-hide around her famous city.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIIP-11" id="Footnote_IIIP-11" href="#FNanchor_IIIP-11"><span class="label">[III'-11]</span></a> This Red r. or Rio Colorado requires attention to discriminate it from
several others of the same name; they are all great streams, not to be confounded,
in spite of their homonymity: 1. Red r. of the North, flowing into
British America between North Dakota and Minnesota: see Part I., <i>passim.</i>
2. Red r., the uppermost and smallest one of three branches of the Arkansaw
which have been so called. This was oftenest called Negracka r., but is
now usually known as the Salt fork of the Arkansaw: see <a href="#Footnote_V-10">note<sup>10</sup>, p. 552</a>. 3.
Red r., the middle one of three branches of the Arkansaw which have been
so called, now known as the Cimarron r.: see <a href="#Footnote_V-10">note<sup>10</sup>, p. 553</a>. 4. Red r., the
lowest and largest of the three branches of the Arkansaw which have been so
called; it is the main fork of the Arkansaw, often known as the Red r. of
Arkansas, oftenest now as the Canadian r.: see <a href="#Footnote_V-17">note<sup>17</sup>, p. 558</a>. 5. The Red r.
of Louisiana, the Red r. of Natchitoches, the Red r. of the Mississippi&mdash;<i>the</i>
Red r. of Pike's Expedition, which he never found. This is the first (lowest)
great branch of the Mississippi from the W., and the one now most commonly
known as the Red r., without any qualifying phrase, probably never called
Colorado r. One of its Indian names is Kecheahquehono, to be found on some
maps. 6. The Red r. of Texas, the one Pike crosses this 16th of June near
Bastrop, and which flows into the Gulf of Mexico at Matagorda, between the
Guadalupe and the Brazos rivers. This is also the Rio Roxo or Rojo, and the
Rio Colorado, of the Spanish, sometimes qualified as Rio Colorado del Este, or
Colorado r. of the East (though it is the southernmost of the lot), to distinguish
it from: 7. Red r. of the West; Rio Colorado del Occidente; Colorado r. of
the West, flowing into the Gulf of California. This has seldom been called
Red r., and is always now known as the Colorado, without qualifying terms, as
we very early adopted the Spanish name. We hear of cowboys who "paint the
town red" in carrying their jags, but that is nothing to the way these rivers
have rubricated maps. Easy alliteration of the words "red" and "river" has
doubtless tended to spread the phrase, in the lack of nomenclatural resources,
and in ignorance of the connections of several of these rivers.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIIP-12" id="Footnote_IIIP-12" href="#FNanchor_IIIP-12"><span class="label">[III'-12]</span></a> The "Tancards" of whom Pike speaks on the 16th and 17th, also called
Tankahuas, Tonkawans, Tankaways, etc., were a remarkable people&mdash;a sort of
Ishmaelites who roamed about, and seemed to belong nowhere in particular.
Powell styles them a "colluvies gentium" or fusion of tribes; and what little
we know of their local habitation is derived mainly from Dr. Sibley's notes,
supplemented by the above passages in Pike's narrative. Dr. Sibley's historical
letter to General Dearborn, dated Natchitoches, Apr. 5th, 1805, and first published
with other tracts in Jefferson's Message to Congress of Feb. 19th, 1806,
is one of the bases of the literature on this subject. "The Tankaways (or
Tanks, as the French call them)," says Sibley, p. 45 of the London ed., 1807,
"have no land, nor claim the exclusive right to any, nor have any particular
place of abode, but are always moving, alternately occupying the country
watered by the Trinity, Braces [Brazos], and Colerado, towards St. a Fé.
Resemble, in their dress, the Cances [Kanzas] and Hietans [Comanches], but
[are] all in one horde or tribe. Their number of men is estimated at about 200;
are good hunters; kill buffaloe and deer with the bow; have the best breed of
horses; are alternately friends and enemies of the Spaniards. An old trader
lately informed me that he has received 5000 deer skins from them in one year,
exclusive of tallow, rugs and tongues. They plant nothing, but live upon fruits
and flesh: are strong, athletic people, and excellent horsemen." The history of
the tribe dates back of Sibley and Pike nearly a century, if the first mention of
these Bedouins of the Texan sands in 1719 be taken as its starting-point. In
1876 Gatschet had collected a vocabulary of about 300 words, upon which linguistic
material he classed the people as a separate stock called Tonkawa, from
the Caddoan or Wakoan word <i>tonkaweya</i>, implying that these Indians kept by
themselves, aloof from other tribes. The Tonkawan family is recognized by
Powell as one of the 58 distinct linguistic stocks he adopts in his classification;
his map locates the tribe agreeably with the above indications, and his text
adds: "About 1847 they were engaged as scouts in the United States Army, and
from 1860-62 (?) were in the Indian Territory; after the secession war till 1884
they lived in temporary camps near Fort Griffin, Shackleford County, Texas, and
in October, 1884, they removed to the Indian Territory (now on Oakland Reserve).
In 1884 there were 78 individuals living; associated with them were 19 Lipan
Apache" (Seventh Ann. Rep. Bur. Ethn., 1885-86, published 1891, p. 126).
Two other Tonkawan tribes, the Mayes and Yakwal, are extinct or merged in
the former; and several minor bands have been known by name.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIIP-13" id="Footnote_IIIP-13" href="#FNanchor_IIIP-13"><span class="label">[III'-13]</span></a> The full style of this river was el Rio de los Brazos de Dios, River of the
Arms of God, which seemed neither blasphemous nor sacrilegious to the admirable
fanatics who so solemnly theographized geography in their excursions for
the salvation of souls, ad majorem Dei gloriam. It is difficult for us to realize
what a queer lot they were, with their "Monastery Road" to the "Opening of
the Virgin," their Corpus Christi in one place and Sangre de Cristo elsewhere,
Holy Ghost bay, Todos Santos collectively when they ran out of individual
saints, and Rio Trinidad for the whole Trinity after the members of the divine
family had been separately complimented. It is fortunate that we cannot
commit the intellectual anachronism of putting ourselves in the place of these
very sincere servants of a very moderate polytheism, though the result be that
the Brazos is also called Brasses and Braces r., bringing up a ludicrous association
of ideas with the buttons and suspenders which uphold our trousers, ad
majorem pudorem virorum. Other names of this stream are Rivière Ste.
Thérèse (or Rio Santa Teresa), and R. Maligne; thus the phrase "St.
Théreseor or Maline R." appears on the map in Winterbotham's History, 1795.
The river is the largest one of the series Pike is crossing; it drains a great area
in Texas from the Llanos Estacados or Staked Plains to the Gulf, which it
reaches between Galveston and Matagorda. The point at which the old
Spanish trail struck it is indicated by Pike's mention of the Little Brazos, a
sort of bayou or side-sluice which runs close to the E. side of the main stream
for a great distance. The crossing was near the mouth of this bayou.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIIP-14" id="Footnote_IIIP-14" href="#FNanchor_IIIP-14"><span class="label">[III'-14]</span></a> The streams passed to-day are tributaries of the Brazos, the larger one
mentioned being that afterward known as Navasota r., which falls in a good
way below, at or near a place which was once named Washington. The high land
on the other side, on which was camp, represents some of the elevation which
forms the water-shed between Brazos and Trinity rivers, and which is passed
over next day. The clause of the text reading "impassable four miles. Overflows
swamps, ponds, etc.," I suppose may be read "impassable for (some) miles
(along its course, where it) overflows (in) swamps, ponds, etc."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIIP-15" id="Footnote_IIIP-15" href="#FNanchor_IIIP-15"><span class="label">[III'-15]</span></a> The original Rio Trinidad has become better known under its equivalent
English name of the Trinity, and there is a place lower down on it which
is or was called Trinidad or Trinity (now Swartwout?). It empties into Galveston
bay, and so into the Gulf. The Spanish trail from the crossing led on
to a place called Crockett, in Houston Co., at or near which camp of the 21st
was pitched. A little above the crossing, on the E. bank of the river, we are
informed by Dr. Sibley, was the residence of the Keyes or Keychias, a Caddoan
tribe which in 1805 mustered 60 men. These are now called Kichais, and
now or lately consisted of about 60 persons.</p>

presumptively supplied from Pike's map, where the post is marked to that
effect.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIIP-17" id="Footnote_IIIP-17" href="#FNanchor_IIIP-17"><span class="label">[III'-17]</span></a> Natches and Neches are obviously the same Indian word, the root of which
appears in Natchitoches and various other names. The two have run through
the usual range of variation in spelling in the course of writing and printing;
but of late years the form Natchez has become fixed as the name of the well-known
city on the Mississippi below Vicksburg, while the designation of the
river has perhaps acquired stability in the form of Neches. The latter is the
principal stream between the Trinity and the Sabine; it runs south approximately
parallel with both, and falls into the Gulf through Sabine l., as the Sabine
does; in fact, it is collateral with the Sabine, and has been considered a branch
of the latter. The Spanish trail crossed it high up. Its own main branch is
that eastern one known as Rio Angelina or Angeline r., which Pike crosses on
the 24th; and E. of a small branch of the latter was the site of Nacogdoches. It
is now an obscure village, pop. about 1,200, seat of the county of its own name,
which occupies a space between Angelina and Atoyac rivers; but the place is
an old one, which, like all the others which the Spanish trail went through, has
a long ethnic, civil, and military history. Neches or Natches r. is to be particularly
noted as the ancient seat of a tribe of Indians who, though a mere
handful a century ago, left their name as a legacy for all time. Sibley (<i>l. c.</i>,
p. 43) speaks of "a small river, a branch of the Sabine, called the Naches,"
on which lived the "Inies, or Tachies (called indifferently by both names),"
and adds: "From the latter name the name of the province of Tachus
or Taxus is derived," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, Texas. Among the permutations of the word
and its derivatives not the least singular is the English adjective and noun
<i>Texican</i>&mdash;a word obviously formed upon the model of <i>Mexican</i> from <i>Mexico</i>.
I suppose this is modern, and what may be termed cowboy dialect; I used to
hear it constantly when I was in those parts.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIIP-18" id="Footnote_IIIP-18" href="#FNanchor_IIIP-18"><span class="label">[III'-18]</span></a> Three lacunæ in this sentence, two of which I fill, omitting the other, which
was a long dash in place of the Frenchman's name. We seem bound by Pike's
map to supply "Toyac" as the missing name of the river he means, though
there is certainly no such large river as he lays down between the Neches and
the Sabine. The map is evidently at fault here, for he runs the Neches into
Trinity r., and thus into Galveston bay, and his "Rio Toyac" comes nearer
exhibiting the proper relations of the Neches with the Sabine. Exactly what
his great "Rio Toyac" may pass for is thus questionable, but the "little river"
of the text, which he crosses after leaving Nacogdoches, must be the present
Atoyac r. (the branch of the Angelina which separates Nacogdoches Co. from
San Augustin Co., for the most part). The route continues to-day past San
Augustin, which was on the Spanish trail, and on or near another small branch
of the Angelina, which runs between San Augustin Co. and Sabine Co. The
place where he stopped on the 28th, only three hours' march from the Sabine,
and where he found both Frenchmen and Americans, was evidently the exact
locality of which Sibley speaks concerning certain Caddoan Indians known as
Aliche, Eyeish, or Eyish. They were then on the verge of extinction, having
been in 1801 reduced by the smallpox till only 25 of them were left in 1805.
Writing in the latter year he says (<i>l. c.</i>, p. 43) that "they were, some years ago,
a considerable nation, and lived on a bayou which bears their name, which the
road from Nachitoch to Nacogdoches crosses, about 12 miles west of Sabine r.,
on which a few French and American families are settled." These data fix
Pike's camp with precision.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIIP-19" id="Footnote_IIIP-19" href="#FNanchor_IIIP-19"><span class="label">[III'-19]</span></a> The former office of the Sabine or Mexican r. in delimiting Spanish from
American possessions continues to-day in so far as it represents the boundary between
Texas and Louisiana. On crossing it, our fervid young patriot passed
from the military protection of his Catholic Majesty to that of his Brother Jonathan
and Uncle Sam&mdash;the former of these two, by the way, being as actual a
person as King Charles IV. of Spain, and no other than Jonathan Trumbull of
Connecticut. The Spanish trail entered what is now the State of Louisiana at
a point between Hamilton and Sabinetown, both of which were places on the
Texan side of the river. The crossing was but little above Sabinetown, and
between two small watercourses known as Bayou San Patricio and Bayou San
Miguel, both running in Sabine Co., La. His camp of the 30th seems to have
been between Bayou Miguel and the next below, now called Lennan; and
these two I suppose to be the ones he lays down as running into the Sabine
together, as they do, pretty nearly.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIIP-20" id="Footnote_IIIP-20" href="#FNanchor_IIIP-20"><span class="label">[III'-20]</span></a> General Wilkinson's "marquee," the location of which Pike took pleasure
in imagining, was the large tent used by field and general officers; the name
is not often heard now, though the word is hardly obsolete. Old Fort Jesup
was built directly on the continuation of the Spanish trail in Louisiana, rather
less than half-way from the Sabine to Red r. A short distance S. of this
was a place whose name appears on various maps as Many, Manny, Maney,
and by accident Mary&mdash;the latter on Emory's, 1857-58, which I think is one
of the most accurate and altogether useful maps ever drawn to a scale of
1 : 6,000,000. A glance at this shows Pike's trail from the Rio Grande to the
Red r. in all its main features; and though many desirable details are necessarily
lacking, not one is misleading.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIIP-21" id="Footnote_IIIP-21" href="#FNanchor_IIIP-21"><span class="label">[III'-21]</span></a> This short clause brings up a number of interesting points. The hill is
among the slight elevations which together form the water-shed between the
Sabine and Red r. This rise of ground corresponds in a general way with the
boundary between Sabine and Nachitoches cos. in Louisiana, parting the numberless
and mostly unnamed small waters which make on either hand for their
respective outlets in the two rivers. Pike is already on the Red River side, among
the runs which discharge into the body of water known as the Spanish l.,
and which finds its way into Red r. by various channels. This is the place
where "anciently stood," as he informs us, the village of the mysterious tribe
of Indians he calls Adyes and Adayes. These have a long history; but the literature
of the subject is mainly a presentation of our ignorance. Powell says
that the first mention of them occurs in the Naufragios of Cabeça de Vaca, who
calls them Atayos, about 1540, and that they are also noted by various early
French explorers of the Mississippi, as d'Iberville and Joutel. The fortified
camp of which Pike speaks was built in 1715 and known as the Mission of
Adayes. From documents preserved in San Antonio de Bexar, examined by
Mr. A. S. Gatschet in 1886, it appears that 14 Adai families emigrated to a
place S. of that town in 1792; these were afterward lost sight of. According
to Baudry de Lozieres, as cited by Powell, 100 Adaizans were left at home in
1802. Turning to Sibley (<i>l. c.</i> p. 42), we find that in 1805 there were 20 men
and more women living "about 40 miles from Natchitoches, below the Yattassees
[a tribe that lived on Bayou Pierre or Stony creek], on a lake called Lac Macdon,
which communicated with the division of Red river that passes by Bayau Pierre.
They live at or near where their ancestors have lived from time immemorial.
They being the nearest nation to the old Spanish fort, or Mission of Adaize,
that place was named after them, being about 20 miles from them, to the south."
Dr. Sibley collected a vocabulary of about 250 words, the sole basis we have
for the modern scientific classification of the tribe, upon the only sure principle
of natural generation as indicated by mother-tongues. "Their language differs
from all others," says Dr. Sibley, "and is so difficult to speak or understand,
that no [other] nation can speak ten words of it: but they all speak
Caddo, and most of them French." He adds that they were always attached
to the latter, with whom they sided against the Natchez; and that after the
Natchez massacre of 1798, while the Spanish occupied Fort Adaize, the priests
took much pains in vain to make them believe what was told them about Catholic
dogma. This is practically the sum of what is known of these evidently
intelligent and manly people; the rest of the literature is mainly the conclusions
reached upon the subject by various authors. The consensus of opinion very
properly classifies the Adaize, Adaizi, Adaise, Adaes, Adees, Adayes, Adyes,
Adahi, or Adai, as a distinct linguistic stock, lately called the Adaizan family,
whose affinities, more or less remote, are with the Caddoan.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IIIP-22" id="Footnote_IIIP-22" href="#FNanchor_IIIP-22"><span class="label">[III'-22]</span></a> Natchitoches, or some other form of this word, was originally the name of
a certain tribe of Indians of the Southern Caddoan family, and of the island on
which they dwelt in Red r., at the site of the town which later arose there and
is still so called. We hear of these people and their place very early in French
colonial history. In Sept., 1688, Henri de Tonti was visited at his Fort St.
Louis on the Illinois, by Couture, one of his men whom he had left at Arkansas
Post in 1686, who apprized him of La Salle's tragic death. He set off (he says,
in Oct., 1689&mdash;probably a wrong date from memory) in Dec., 1688, descended
the Illinois and Miss. rivers to Red r., and went up this, reaching the Natchitoches
Feb. 17th and the Caddodaquis Mar. 28th, 1689: so Parkman's La
Salle, etc., p. 439. He was told that some of the assassins or those in the plot
to murder their leader were at a village of the Naouadiches, some 85 leagues
S. W., whither he went, but found no trace of Hiens and his confederates.
After much suffering, including an illness at his Arkansas Post, he regained
Fort St. Louis Sept., 1689: Wallace, Hist. Ill. and La., 1893, p. 188 <i>seq.</i> According
to this authority the present town dates from Jan., 1717, when Antoine
de la Mothe Cadillac, governor of Louisiana under Crozat, sent a sergeant and
some soldiers to establish a post on the island, which was commanded <i>ca.</i>
1721-28 by Louis Juchereau de St. Denis (b. Quebec, Sept. 18th, 1676, d. <i>post</i>
1731). This notable character, uncle of D'Iberville's wife, Chevalier, etc., is
the "Mons. St. Dennie" of Sibley's notice of the Natchitoches, p. 49, where it
is said he was still in command after the Natchez massacre of 1728; "the Indians
called him the Big Foot, were fond of him, for he was a brave man." According
to Gayarré, Hist. La., II. p. 355, the foreign population of Natchitoches
was 811 by a census made under Gov. O'Reilly, <i>ca.</i> 1769, or when the French
had been in Louisiana 70 years. Sibley, writing at Natchitoches Apr. 5th, 1805,
says that an elderly French gentleman then living had shortly before informed
him that the informant remembered when the Natchitoches were 600 men
strong: this should represent <i>ca.</i> 3,000 total souls.</p>

Provinces of New Spain, from Louisiana to the Vice Royalty, and between the

bringing news of great public interest in 1810. Much of it was original; how
much of it was borrowed without acknowledgement could only be said after
careful examination of prior works on the same subject. It should be compared
with Humboldt and Bonpland's Political Essay on the Kingdom of New
Spain, with a Physical and Geographical Atlas, etc., 2 vols., 4to, with atlas,
folio, of 20 plates. Pike's two maps of Mexico will be best understood in
connection with the same source of information: see <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43774/43774-h/43774-h.htm#Page_XIX">Memoir</a>, <i>anteà</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-2" id="Footnote_IVP-2" href="#FNanchor_IVP-2"><span class="label">[IV'-2]</span></a> Nueva España (New Spain) is a term whose geographical and political
connotation has varied much. As the colonial name of what we call Mexico it
was first applied to Yucatan and Tabasco by Grijalva, in 1518, and next extended
to all the Cortesian conquests. The kingdom of New Spain proper
was a region under the audience of Mexico, which corresponded closely to the
modern states of Yucatan, Campeche, Tabasco, Vera Cruz, Hidalgo, Guanajuato,
Michoacan, Colima, Mexico, Morelos, Tlascala, Puebla, Guerrero,
Oajaca, and Chiapas. The viceroyalty of New Spain, dating from 1535,
when the first viceroy, Mendoza, entered in possession, was much more comprehensive,
as it embraced all the Spanish possessions in Central and North
America, from the S. boundary of Costa Rica, as well as the West Indies and
the Spanish East Indies. Its political composition was the five audiences of
Mexico, Guadalajara, Guatemala, Santo Domingo, and Manila, and the captaincy-general
of Florida. During the eighteenth century the East Indies and
Guatemala were excluded from the viceroyalty. The viceroyalty of New
Spain, as the term was most generally used, long consisted of the three
"kingdoms" of New Spain, New Galicia, and New Leon. This corresponded
to modern Mexico, plus then undefined territories of Texas, New Mexico, and
California, now parts of the United States. On the separation in 1793 of the
Provincias Internas or Internal Provinces, the viceroyalty of New Spain corresponded
to the present Mexico, plus the Californias, but minus southern
Coahuila, Durango, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, and Sonora. Spanish viceroyalty
ceased in 1821, but "New Spain" was not finally "Mexico" till 1824 (during
the Empire under Iturbide, 1822-28). The term "Provincias Internas" was
vaguely used, as early as the seventeenth century, for the northern parts of New
Spain or Mexico. "In 1777 (by order of Aug. 22, 1776) a new government was
formed under this name, completely separated from the viceroyalty of New
Spain, and comprising Nueva Vizcaya ([New Biscay] Durango and Chihuahua),
Coahuila, Texas, New Mexico, Sinaloa, Sonora, and the Californias. The
Capital was Arizpe in Sonora, and the audience of Guadalajara retained its
judicial authority; the governor was also military commandant. In 1786 and
1787-93 the government was again subordinate to the viceroy. When the final
separation was made in 1793, California was attached to Mexico," Cent. Cyclop.,
1894, <i>s. v.</i>, p. 828. This last "New Spain" is Pike's; and the present
article is mainly devoted to the Provincias Internas of this New Spain&mdash;excepting
that nothing is said of the Californias.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-3" id="Footnote_IVP-3" href="#FNanchor_IVP-3"><span class="label">[IV'-3]</span></a> El Reino de Nueva Galicia, or New Galicia, was a prime division of colonial
New Spain, whose limits fluctuated, like those of most Mexican political
divisions, but for most of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries corresponded
nearly to the modern states of Jalisco, Aguas Calientes, and Zacatecas, plus a
small part of San Luis Potosí. The audience of Guadalajara, originating in
1548, had jurisdiction over this Nueva Galicia; in 1786 the latter became the
intendency of Guadalajara; and after 1792 the Provincias Internas were
judicially subordinate to the audience of Guadalajara. Pike's "administration
of Guadalaxara" corresponds inexactly to the present State of Jalisco or Xalisco.
This lies on the Pacific coast, bordered by the states of Sinaloa, Durango,
Zacatecas, Aguas Calientes, Guanajuato, Michoacan, and Colima; area, 27,261
sq. m.; pop., 1,280,500; capital, Guadalajara. The situation of this city is
lat. 21° N., long. 103° 10´ W.; it was founded in 1542, and is now the second
largest city in Mexico, pop. 95,000. That "one of the Gusman family," who
Pike says built it "in 1551" was probably Nuño or Nuñez Bertrande Guzman,
b. Guadalajara (in Spain) about 1485, d. there 1544; he was the enemy of
Cortés, and the conqueror of New Galicia. Rio Grande de Santiago is the
largest river in the state, and Lago de Chapala, which lies mostly within its
limits, is the largest lake in Mexico; area, over 1,300 sq. m.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-4" id="Footnote_IVP-4" href="#FNanchor_IVP-4"><span class="label">[IV'-4]</span></a> Valladolid was the name of an old Castilian province in Spain, and of the
capital of that province; it was applied to a political division in Mexico
which has entirely disappeared, though corresponding to some extent to the
present State of Michoacan. The capital of this was also called Valladolid until
1828, when it was changed to present Morelia, in honor of the patriot priest
José Maria Morelos y Pavon, b. there Sept. 30th, 1765; joined the revolt of
Hidalgo, 1810; was captured Nov. 15th, 1815; executed Dec. 22d, 1815,
near the City of Mexico.</p>

In general terms it was a south central portion of Mexico with an extensive
Pacific coast line, but cut off from the Atlantic by Vera Cruz and Puebla, and
bordered on the N. by San Luis Potosí, etc. The present State of Mexico is
an area of somewhat over 9,000 sq. m., bounded by Querétaro, Hidalgo,
Tlascala, Puebla, Morelos, Guerrero, and Michoacan. Its capital is Toluca; for
the City of Mexico, capital of the republic, is in a small Federal District set
apart from the rest of the state (like our District of Columbia), with an area of
only 463 sq. m. The pop. of the present State of Mexico is about 830,000;
the capital city of the republic has a pop. of 330,000; its situation is lat. 19°

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-7" id="Footnote_IVP-7" href="#FNanchor_IVP-7"><span class="label">[IV'-7]</span></a> Vera Cruz is the long, narrow maritime state of Mexico, with the Gulf on
the E., Tamaulipas on the N., and then bordered on the W., S., and E., successively,
by San Luis Potosí, Hidalgo, Puebla, Oajaca, Chiapas, and Tabasco.
The land is low along the Gulf, or in the <i>tierra caliente</i>, but soon rises to the
mountainous <i>tierra fria</i> of most of the state. The whole area is 27,450 sq.
m.; pop. 642,000. The long-famous seaport of Vera Cruz is the principal city,
pop. 24,000, in lat. 19° 12´ N., long. 96° 9´ E. This was founded near the
present site by Cortés in May, 1519, by the name of Villa Rica de la Vera
Cruz; site changed to the Rio de la Antigua in 1525; to present position in
1599; became City of Vera Cruz in 1615; was taken by the French in 1838,
by the Americans in 1848, by the Allies in 1861. The celebrated Picacho of
Orizaba, 10 m. N. of Orizaba, alt. 18,314 feet, is on the boundary between
Vera Cruz and Puebla. This is the highest mountain of N. America, except
Mt. St. Elias.</p>

was taken by the French in 1863. The famous peak of Popocatepetl, or
Smoking mt., a volcano about 17,800 feet high, is on the boundary between
this state and Mexico, 45 m. S. E. of the city of the latter name; and N. of
that peak is another volcano, Ixtaccihuatl or the "Woman in White," over

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-12" id="Footnote_IVP-12" href="#FNanchor_IVP-12"><span class="label">[IV'-12]</span></a> Nuevo Santander, whose history is something of a political curiosity, was
originally a division of colonial New Spain, and continued to be known as a
colony until 1786. The extent was about that of the present State of Tamaulipas,
bounded substantially as Pike says, though it once overreached the Rio
Grande into what is now Texas. Tamaulipas has Texas on the N., separated
by the Rio Grande; the Gulf of Mexico on the E.; Nuevo Leon and Coahuila
on the W.; San Luis Potosí on the S. W. and S.; with a small extent of Vera
Cruz on the extreme S.; area, 29,350 sq. m.; pop. about 173,000; capital,
Ciudad Victoria. The river, on one of whose headwaters this city is situated,
falls into the Gulf near the Barra de Santander, as it is still called, about 60
Mexican leagues S. of the mouth of the Rio Grande, and rather less than 40
such leagues N. of Tampico; its length is supposed to be about 150 m.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-13" id="Footnote_IVP-13" href="#FNanchor_IVP-13"><span class="label">[IV'-13]</span></a> Or Nuevo Reino de Leon, as it was long styled. This was a division of
colonial New Spain, corresponding to the present State of Nuevo Leon, but,
when a kingdom, including certain portions of what are now Tamaulipas and
San Luis Potosí; it was attached to the intendency of the latter in 1786. New
Leon still has Tamaulipas along the whole of its E. border, excepting that
its northern panhandle is environed by Coahuila, which thence extends on its
W. side to San Luis Potosí, which latter thence curves to meet Tamaulipas at
the end of the southern panhandle. The shape of some of the Mexican states
would show, in the absence of all history, that earthquakes and volcanoes were
not the only agitations against which New Spain contended in the settling of
some of her geographical problems. Area of New Leon, 24,000 sq. m.; pop.
272,000; capital, Monterey: for Pike's location of Monterey on "Tiger" r.,
see <a href="#Footnote_IIP-33">note<sup>33</sup>, p. 682</a>, May 18th, 1807. The position of this city is about lat.
25° 40´ N., long. 100° 25´ W.; pop. 46,000; it is best known to us as a prize
captured by the U. S. forces under Z. Taylor, Sept. 23d, 1846. The Count of
Monterey was one Caspar de Zuñiga y Azevedo, b. <i>ca.</i> 1540, d. Lima, Peru,
Feb. 10th, 1606, viceroy of Mexico, Oct. 5th, 1595-1603, of Peru, Nov. 28th,
1604, till death; Monterey bay, Cal., named for him. The American officer
whom Pike names was Edward D. Turner of Massachusetts, who entered the
army as an ensign of the 2d Inf. Mar. 4th, 1791; became a lieutenant July 13th,
1792: captain of the 2d sub-Legion Nov. 11th, 1793, and of the 2d Inf.
Nov. 1st, 1796; served as brigade inspector from Nov. 1st, 1799, to Apr. 1st,
1802; was retained as a captain of the 1st Inf. from the latter date, and
resigned Nov. 30th, 1805.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-14" id="Footnote_IVP-14" href="#FNanchor_IVP-14"><span class="label">[IV'-14]</span></a> This comes at the end of the present dissertation, when Pike has finished
with his account of the Internal Provinces, to which he now proceeds. Two of
these, Sonora and Sinaloa, are "internal" to the extent of bordering on the
Gulf of California and not on the high sea. These he never saw; those he
traversed correspond to the present three Mexican states of Chihuahua, Durango,
and Coahuila, and to our Territory of New Mexico, State of Texas, and
a small part of the State of Louisiana. Most of the commentary that would
otherwise be here offered has already been put upon Pike's itinerary through
these regions; but some points will come up for further criticism or explanation.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-15" id="Footnote_IVP-15" href="#FNanchor_IVP-15"><span class="label">[IV'-15]</span></a> New Mexico, as long as it was a province of New Spain, could not be satisfactorily
bounded, for the simple reason that its boundaries were never clearly
defined. Pike's ascription of lat. 44° N. sends it up to the shadowy border of
"the Oregan"&mdash;that No Man's Land till Lewis and Clark descended the
Columbia to the South Sea. This is no place to open the celebrated quarrel
over boundaries that hovered in the air like clouds on political paper; suffice it,
that when the Oregan became an undisputed possession of any nation, it already
belonged to the United States. Away from the Pacific coast, Spanish dominion
never exceeded 38° N. in fact, whatever it may have been on paper at any
time. Shortly after Pike's time, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, from Feb. 22d, 1819, an intelligible
theoretical boundary was agreed upon by the United States and Spain, though
it was never run upon the ground. This line, aside from any question of the
still unsettled boundary of Texas, ran from the Red r. to the Arkansaw r. on
the meridian of 100° W. from Greenwich, up the Arkansaw to its source,
thence due N. on whatever the meridian might prove to be to lat. 42° N.,
thence on that parallel due W. to the Pacific. Spanish Nuevo Mejico was
quietly captured without resistance by the U. S. Army of the West under
Kearny in 1846; formally ceded in 1848; organized as a U. S. territory in 1850;
its southern boundary changed by the acquisition of the Gadsden purchase and
definitely established in 1853; Arizona detached on the W. in 1863 along the
meridian of 109° W.; eastern boundary, the meridian of 103° W.; present area,
122,460 sq. m.; pop. in 1890 given as 153,593. Thus, to all intents and practical
purposes, Pike's "New Mexico" is our New Mexico and Arizona, and thence
indefinitely northward. Present Arizona has an area of 112,920 sq. m.; pop.
59,620 by the census of 1890. In December, 1863, Governor John N. Goodwin
and Secretary Richard C. McCormick, with other new Territorial officials,
entered into possession on the ground, and formally proclaimed their functions.
They proceeded to establish the capital on Granite cr., a tributary of the Rio
Verde, and named it Prescott, for the historian, after having deliberated whether
to call it Audubon, for the ornithologist. The log house built for the gubernatorial,
secretarial, and all other functions was there when I last saw it, in 1892,
and still the residence of one of the original party, Judge Fleury, who in the
course of time exercised his versatile talent in every capacity, from cook to acting
governor. Arizona is thus politically in its 32d year now (1895). Its historic
period dates from 1540 or 1536; the prehistoric compass of time, since it
was first inhabited, is very likely not exceeded by the Christian era&mdash;to judge
from recent exhumations in the valley of the Gila, revealing a cluster of cities
6 m. long. Those who named the present capital Ph&oelig;nix builded better than
they knew&mdash;the name, I mean, not the mud hovels and wicker-work jacals
which adorn some portions of that new center of political intrigue to which
were lately shifted the inevitable dissensions that arose between the northern
mountaineers and the southern deserteers.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-16" id="Footnote_IVP-16" href="#FNanchor_IVP-16"><span class="label">[IV'-16]</span></a> To correct in detail all such statements would hardly come within the scope
of cursory notes, and I usually pass them over, as anyone can easily inform
himself of the adjustment required for geographical precision. But in this particular
instance it is well to remember that Pike had acquired an erroneous
notion of the source of the Yellowstone, from considering the <i>South</i> Platte to be
the whole Platte, thus throwing the <i>North</i> Platte out of court. Having no
knowledge of this great river, he fancied there was some spot whence he could
walk in a day to the source of any one of the four he names&mdash;a feat for which
the seven-leagued boots of fable would be required: see <a href="#Footnote_IV-5">note<sup>5</sup>, p. 524</a>. For
some particulars concerning the Rio Grande, see <a href="#Footnote_IP-32">note<sup>32</sup>, p. 642</a>. To the
different names which the river had in different regions, add Rio Abajo and Rio
Arriba for lower and upper sections, not well defined but conveniently recognized,
of Rio del Norte above El Paso. Pike is quite right in the matter of Rio
Bravo&mdash;a name never applied to the river in any portion of its course which he
traversed in New Mexico.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-17" id="Footnote_IVP-17" href="#FNanchor_IVP-17"><span class="label">[IV'-17]</span></a> Whatever the real implication of names bestowed upon actual or alleged
branches of the Colorado by the early explorers from whom Pike drew his
inspiration, as Escalante 1777, it is not difficult to identify those he uses, even
when his text does not agree with his map, as happens in some cases. From
the Rio Gila, for which see <a href="#Footnote_IVP-19">note<sup>19</sup></a>, we will follow his map upward. 1. "Rio
S<sup>n.</sup> Maria" of the map, not in the text. The name Santa Maria held for many
years for the branch of the Colorado now called Bill Williams' fork. This is
composed of two main streams, to one of which the name Santa Maria is now
usually restricted; the other is called Big Sandy. Bill Williams' fork does not
head in Bill Williams' mountain, being cut off from that by the Rio Verde, etc.;
its basin lies entirely W. of Aubrey and Chino valleys, and of the Prescott plains.
This river drains westward from the Santa Maria, Granite, Juniper, Weaver,
and other ranges in Arizona, and falls into the Colorado from the E. at a place
called Aubrey City, the site of which was pointed out to me by a native when
I navigated the Colorado in 1865, though I saw nothing like a city. 2. There
is no mention in the text, nor any sign on the map, of the Colorado Chiquito,
otherwise Little Colorado r., though this is a large water-course which, when it
runs, drains an extensive area in N. Arizona. This stream heads about the White,
Mogollon, and other ranges on or near the confines of New Mexico; receives
from the Zuñian mts. its main fork, Rio Puerco of the West; flows N. W. past
(E. of) the San Francisco and Bill Williams' peaks, and falls into the Colorado
from the S. E., well up in the Grand Cañon of the latter; its own lower courses
are terribly cañonous for a great distance, its bed being riven in chasms comparable
even with the awful abyss of the Colorado itself. 3. Non-appearance
of the Colorado Chiquito affects to some extent the identification of the river
called in the text "de los Anamas or Nabajoa" and lettered on the map "Rio
Jasquevilla." This is laid down as a large eastern branch of the Colorado which
falls in <i>above</i> the Grand Cañon, and on which lived the "Nahjo" (Navajo) and
"Cosninas" (Cojnino) Indians, and <i>south</i> of which were the "Indiens Moqui,
Independent since 1680," in four villages lettered "Oraybe," "Mosanis,"
"Songoapt," and "Gualpi"&mdash;for, though the Moki legend is set astride of the
river itself, it belongs to these four villages S. of the river. The stream in question
certainly was meant for the Colorado Chiquito; but most of its ascribed
characters are those of Rio San Juan of N. W. New Mexico, N. E. Arizona,
and S. E. Utah. The leaning toward the Colorado Chiquito is shown by the
location of the Cojnino Indians on this stream, and its passage next N. of the
circle of ten peaks lettered "Sierra de los Cosninas"&mdash;these indicating the San
Francisco, Bill Williams', and other mountains of central Arizona; but identification
with the San Juan is possible by the location of the Navajos on its headwaters
and of the Mokis further S., as well as by its entrance into the Colorado
<i>above</i> the Grand Cañon&mdash;for Pike charts the upper end of the cañon as the
"Puerto del Bacorelli." Rio San Juan heads in N. W. New Mexico, next W.
of the Rio Grande basin, having numerous collateral sources there and in contiguous
parts of N. E. Arizona and S. W. Colorado; hence it enters S. E.
Utah and runs to the Colorado around the base of Mt. Navajo, thus including
in its ramifications adjacent corners of two states and two territories; two of
its affluents retain to this day the names Rio de las Animas and Rio Navajo, respectively.
Among its larger tributaries may be mentioned Rio Chusco, Chasco,
or Chaco, and especially Rio Chelly&mdash;the latter being that one the mystery
of whose famous Cañon de Chelly was fathomed by Captain J. H. Simpson in
1859. The two strange words which Pike uses in this connection, "<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43776/43776-h/43776-h.htm#Bacorelli">Bacorelli</a>"
and "<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43776/43776-h/43776-h.htm#Jasquevilla">Jasquevilla</a>," both treated in the Index, are not the same as Jicarilla,
present name of certain mountains in Arizona and of a certain tribe of Indians
called in Arizona "Hickory" Apaches. 4. The fact that the Grand Cañon of
the Colorado is indicated on Pike's map may be certified in more than one way:
(<i>a</i>) He marks below it certain "Indiens Chemequaba," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, Chemehuevi,
a Shoshonean tribe then as now living in Arizona below the cañon, and thus
isolated from their parent stock among Apaches of Athapascan lineage.
(<i>b</i>) Pike's term "Cosninas," for certain Indians and mountains, is still an
alternative name for the Cosnino, Cojnino, or Cataract Cañon, a side-spur of the
Grand Cañon, and still the residence of a curious cave-dwelling tribe called
Yavasupai, Havasupi, or Aguazul, who numbered 214 when I visited them in
1881. (<i>c</i>) The trans-continental route via the Arkansaw and Colorado rivers,
which Pike suggests as the "best communication from ocean to ocean," need not
be supposed to run through the Grand Cañon, but rather to approximate that
lately achieved by the Atlantic and Pacific R. R., connecting on the E. with the
A., T., and S. F. R. R., on the W. with the So. Cala. R. R. 5. West of the
Grand Cañon Pike traces a problematical "Rio de los Panami des surfurcas on
ignore l Embouchure," without beginning or end. This suggests Virgin r.,
whose junction with the Colorado in Nevada was then unknown. 6. Above
the Grand Cañon, Pike forks the Colorado distinctly into two main branches,
referable of course to the Grand and the Green rivers. 7. The main course of
Grand r. is lettered "Rio de los Duimas," for which read Las Animas&mdash;but not
"Los Anamas or Nabajoa" of Pike's text, already accounted for. This
"Duimas" may be taken as intended to represent the whole course of Grand r.
and its branches, as the Gunnison, etc. 8. The main course of the "Duimas"
or Grand r. is what Pike means by Rio "de los Dolores" of the text, nameless
on his map. This is the Dolores r. of present geography, running chiefly in
Colorado, but joining the Grand in Utah. Pike forks this; one of these forks
is the continuation of the Dolores; the other is present San Miguel r. of
Colorado. 9. Green r. is the one lettered "Rio Zanguananos," as the main
continuation of the Colorado itself. This is correct, though the singular
S-shaped course in which it is laid down is so far out of drawing that the two
branches of it which he names are thrown in the wrong direction. These two
are the San Rafael and San Xavier of both text and map. The first one of
them is present San Rafael r.; and if we take Pike's San Xavier to be the next
above on the same side, it corresponds to Price r. We must not seek for any
streams higher up the Grand than Price r.; the early Spanish travelers did not
get very far in that direction; and Pike sets all these streams considerably S. of
Great Salt l., not beyond the latitude he assigns to the head of the Rio Grande.
The old Spanish trail from Colorado into Utah passed a certain Sierra La Sal,
or Salt mt., which is situated near the confluence of the Green and the
Grand; continued across both these rivers a little above their junction, and so
on westward between the San Rafael r. and the San Xavier or Price r., into the
basin of present Sevier r. and Sevier l. Now Pike sets his "Montaigne de Sel,"
or Mountain of Salt, close to the main Rio Zanguananos or Green r., and directly
against the mouth of his San Rafael. This particular combination could not have
been accidental, and seems to show what was really mapped, though so distortedly.
As intimated in beginning this note, I have attempted identifications without
prejudice to any original implication of the Spanish records, but solely according
to what I find in Pike. The early names themselves seem open to the interpretation
here offered, and I know from several futile attempts which I made that
Pike's geography of the Colorado basin would be hard to square with the facts
in any other way. Should the present identifications be acceptable, some
hitherto unsurmounted difficulties would prove to have been overcome.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-18" id="Footnote_IVP-18" href="#FNanchor_IVP-18"><span class="label">[IV'-18]</span></a> This paragraph is contradicted by the map, on which "Rio de S<sup>ta</sup>.
Buenaventura" runs W. into a nameless lake, S. of a certain Lac de Timpanagos,
and is the first river, N. and W. of Green r., that does not connect with the
Colorado. The Buenaventura is a ghost-river which haunted geography for
many years. Nothing like such a river as this was represented to be exists&mdash;it
is as much of a myth in Utah and California as Lahontan's fabulous Long r. in
Minnesota and Dakota. But it is a rule with hardly an exception that every
myth has some basis of fact. In so far as Pike's Buenaventura represents anything
in nature, I imagine it to be an adumbration of Sevier r., and its sink to be
Lake Sevier, in the western part of Utah, S. of Great Salt l. True, the Buenaventura
is laid down very much out of the actual course of the Sevier; but not
more wrongly than Green r. is, and the very curious way in which the Sevier
winds about to reach its sink would hardly have been discovered and correctly
delineated by those early travelers in the "Great American Desert." The
nameless lake itself is not very far out of the way on Pike's map. Possibly
also, the mysterious river, "whose mouth is unknown," may be intended for
some section of the Sevier; for, if we were to connect this trace with Pike's
Buenaventura, we should have a recognizable representation of the Sevier. But
Pike heads his Rio S. Buenaventura, by a principal branch called "Rio de S<sup>n</sup>.
Clemente," in that portion of the continental divide he marks "Sierra Verde,"
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, Green mts., also the source of present Green r. We should note
further in this connection the appearance on Pike's map of New Mexico of a
certain river running northward, lettered "Rio de Piedro Amaretto del Missouri."
Here, "Amaretto" is a mistake of the engraver for <i>Amarillo</i>, the
phrase being Sp. Piedra Amarilla = F. Pierre Jaune or Roche Jaune = E. Yellow
Stone, a principal branch of the Missouri. As we have repeatedly seen already,
Pike was determined to interlock the headwaters of the Yellowstone, Platte,
Arkansaw, and Rio Grande in some one spot in the Rocky mts.&mdash;and here we
have it, just over the divide that separates these Atlantic waters collectively
from those of the general basin of the Colorado. Observe, also, how nearly the
dotted trail of the "Country explored by a Detachment of American Troops
commanded by Captain Pike" reaches to the supposed Yellowstone.</p>

<p class="footnote">The Sevier r. possesses a melancholy interest as the scene of the wanton and
brutal murder by Piute Indians of Captain John Williams Gunnison and most of
his companions, near Sevier l., Oct. 27th, 1853. The particulars are given by
Lieutenant E. G. Beckwith, P. R. R. Rep., II. 1855, pp. 72-74. The massacre
occurred at break of day of the 27th, not on the 26th, as usually reported.
There was no provocation whatever, and no thought of danger on the part of
the devoted band. Those killed, besides Captain Gunnison, were Mr. E. H.
Kern, topographer and artist; Mr. F. Creuzfeldt, botanist; Mr. Wm. Potter,
a citizen of Utah, guide; John Bellows, an employee; and three men of the
military escort, which consisted of a corporal and six privates; only four of the
whole party escaped with their lives. Lieutenant Beckwith expressly exonerates
the Mormons from complicity in the outrage; public opinion thought otherwise;
and the official record of Captain Gunnison's death stands "Killed 26
Oct. 53 by a band of Mormons and Inds near Sevier Lake Utah." The
lamented and accomplished officer met his fate while conducting explorations
and surveys for a railroad route near the 38° and 39° parallels of N. lat. He
had graduated from the U. S. Military Academy at West Point July 31st, 1837,
when he became a second lieutenant of the 2d Artillery; was transferred with
that rank to the corps of Topographical Engineers July 7th, 1838; became first
lieutenant May 9th, 1846; and obtained his captaincy Mar. 3d, 1853.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-19" id="Footnote_IVP-19" href="#FNanchor_IVP-19"><span class="label">[IV'-19]</span></a> Pike acquired a good idea of the Gila, for one who never saw it, and it is
well laid down on his map; though it joins the Colorado a considerable distance
above the head of the Gulf of California, the confluence is below 33°, being in
lat. 32° 43´ 32´´ N., long. 114° 36´ 10´´ W. The Gila was known to the whites
before the Mississippi was discovered; it was long better known than the Rio
Grande, and down to the present century was far better known than the Rio
Colorado. The valley of the Gila was the first seat of semi-civilization within
the present limits of the United States; and Tucson, on the Santa Cruz r., disputes
with St. Augustine in Florida the record of being the oldest continuously
inhabited white settlement in our country; but St. A. was founded by Spaniards
about the middle of the sixteenth century. An early if not the first name of the
Gila was Rio de los Apostolos, more fully Rio Grande de los Apostolos, as the
legend appears, for example, on Vaugondy's map, 1783, where so many apostolic
and canonical towns are marked along the river as to give its valley the
appearance of a well-settled region, including even that ancient and celebrated
structure, the Casa Grande, still extant. Rio de los Apostolos or Apostles' r.
appears on maps of the present century, as for example on the one which Captain
Clark drew at the Mandans in the winter of 1804-5, and which Captain
Lewis dispatched to President Jefferson April 7th, 1805, but which was never
published of full size till September, 1893. Pike's first branch of the Gila is
called "Rio de la Asuncion," with Rio Verde as its main fork. This is correct;
for the river of the Assumption of the B. V. M., whatever may be the myth
upon which such an extraordinary assumption was based, is that now known as
Rio Salinas, Rio Salado, and Salt r., into which the Verde falls near Mt. McDowell
and the fort of the same name. The confluence of Salt r. with the Gila
is below Ph&oelig;nix, present capital of Arizona, and but little above the point
where the Agua Fria also falls into the Gila. The Verde is the principal river
of central Arizona, for the most part flowing southward, though it starts northward
by the headwater called Granite cr. and then makes a loop; this creek is
the site of Prescott, first capital of Arizona on the establishment of the Territory
in 1863, and of Fort Whipple, established by the troops to which I was
attached in July, 1864. Pike's small branch of the Gila lettered "Rio de
Ozul," for which read Rio Azul or Blue r., is the present San Carlos, of which we
lately heard a good deal on account of the unruly Apaches at the agency of
that name. Present Blue cr. is a small branch higher up on the same side, near
Pike's Rio San Francisco, which latter he rightly charts as one of the initial
forks of the Gila. His Rio San Pedro, still so called, is the principal Gileño
tributary from the S. It acquired special importance in connection with the
U. S. and Mexican Boundary Survey. Near this stream he marks "Pres[idio]
de Tubson," at the town of "S<sup>n.</sup> Xavier del bac," in the "Senora" (Sonora) of
that day.</p>

<p class="footnote">The Indian tribes of the Gila valley which are located on the map may be
here noted, as their names do not come up elsewhere in this work, and with
these may also be conveniently considered those which Pike marks on the Colorado
above the Gila. Such are, on the Gila: The Yumas (Cuchans); the
"Cojuenchis"; the "Cucapa" (Cocopas); the Papagos; the "Cocomaricopas"
(Maricopas); and on the Colorado: the "Chemequaba" (Chemehuevis,
who are of Shoshonean stock, as we have already seen); the "Jalchedum";
the "Yabijoias" (Yavapais); the "Yamaya" (Amaquaqua, Amaqua, Majave
or Mohave). All these Indians lived within the present territory of the United
States, occupying the valley of the Gila on both sides from above the junction
of the San Pedro down to the Colorado, and up the Colorado, on the Arizona
side at least, to the Grand Cañon, to the almost entire exclusion of other
tribes. They were bounded on the N. by Shoshonean tribes in California,
Nevada, Utah, and a small part of Arizona; on the E. by Athapascan tribes,
especially the Apaches; on the S., they stretched throughout Lower California,
and far into Mexico. With the single exception just said, the names that I
can identify all are now classed under two main family groups or linguistic
stocks, Piman and Yuman; and all belong to the latter, excepting the Papagos
and the Pimas themselves. 1. The Piman family is mainly Mexican, as of its
nine tribes or divisions only three are Arizonian. Of these, the Sobaipuri, who
lived on the Santa Cruz and San Pedro branches of the Gila, have entirely disappeared.
The Pimas proper, Upper Pimas, or Pimas Altas (so called in distinction
from the Lower Pimas, Pimas Bajas, or Nevomes, of Mexico), have
lived for 200 years on the Gila and Salado, in the position assigned by Pike
to the Cocomaricopas. The Papagos lived further S. and extended into
Mexico. According to late official returns (for 1890), there were 4,464 Pimas
and 5,163 Papagos under the Pima Agency on the Gila. 2. The Yuman
family is less summarily to be disposed of, as the area of its distribution in the
United States is more extensive and its divisions are more numerous, and several
of them are entirely extralimital in Lower California and Mexico. The
name <i>Yuma</i> is given by Whipple as a Cuchan word meaning "sons of the
river." In the early days of our occupation of Arizona some of the tribes
along the Colorado were hostile; but since the subjugation of the Yumas and
Mohaves, followed by the establishment of Fort Yuma and Fort Mohave, they
have given very little trouble, with the exception of the Hualapais or Walapais.
These may be properly classed as Yuman by linguistic affinities, but they are
rather mountain than river Indians, and have within comparatively few years
been most decidedly hostile. In January, 1865, it was my misfortune, which I
shall never cease to regret, to be concerned in a cruel massacre&mdash;for I cannot
call it a fight&mdash;in which about 30 Hualapais were killed, in the Juniper mts., a
very few miles from the spot where Camp Hualapais was later established.
My friend, the late Colonel William Redwood Price, when major of the 8th
Cavalry (d. Dec. 30th, 1881), had the handling of the Hualapais after this; in
1867 they were about 1,500 people, with probably 400 warriors; he killed
probably 175 of them, mostly men, and brought them to terms in 1869, when a
batch of prisoners was sent to San Francisco. In 1881, when we reoccupied
Camp Hualapais and named it Camp Price, a threatened outbreak was averted
by putting a chief in irons. The Hualapais now number perhaps 750, in N.
W. Arizona, and are almost the only members of the Yuman stock in the Territory
whom we have not entirely broken down, pauperized, and debauched.
The shocking syphilization of all the Yuman Indians along the Colorado has
been notorious for many years. The Yumas or Umas proper, or Cuchans, have
been segregated; there are or were lately about 1,000 at the Mission Agency
in California, and 300 at the San Carlos in Arizona. Of the Mohaves, some
650 are at the Colorado River Agency in Arizona, 800 at San Carlos, and perhaps
400 at large. The disestablishment of Fort Mohave is quite recent; I
was post surgeon there in 1881. There are about 300 Maricopas at the Pima
Agency in Arizona. The Cocopas are a small tribe whose census is uncertain;
they live on the California side of the Colorado up to the vicinity of the Gila.
The Yavasupai or Aguazul Indians, who live in Cojnino or Cataract cañon, to
the number of about 200, as already said, <a href="#Footnote_IVP-17">note<sup>17</sup></a>, are entirely cut off from the
world in the bottom of the chasm selected for their abode. Some of them I
found occupying holes in the rock, which they walled up like old-fashioned
cliff-dwellers; while others were sheltered in wickiups scattered about the few
acres of arable ground they could find to irrigate for the cultivation of their
corn, beans, melons, squashes, peaches, apricots, and sunflower-seeds.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-20" id="Footnote_IVP-20" href="#FNanchor_IVP-20"><span class="label">[IV'-20]</span></a> This is the main fork or largest branch of the Rio Grande. As already
remarked, <a href="#Footnote_IP-23">note<sup>23</sup>, p. 632</a>, Pike maps it too high up; for it runs entirely E. of
the mountains (Sacramento, Guadalupe, White, etc.), W. of which he traces it,
and its mouth is 346 m. by the channel of the Rio Grande below the site of
Presidio del Norte, in lat. 29° 40´ N., long. 101° 20´ W. The length of the
river is supposed to be between 700 and 800 m. The Pecos heads in the
mountains immediately W. of Santa Fé&mdash;on the E. side of the Santa Fé range
and W. side of Las Vegas range, among such peaks as the Truchas, Cone,
Baldy, Lake, etc., there flowing due S. before it bears off to the left. It receives
numerous small tributaries, both above and below the point where it passes by
the cañon, old pueblo, and modern town of Pecos. The name is derived from
the old pueblo, which was situated on one of those tributaries in the mountains,
some 25 m. S. E. of Santa Fé. The Pecos have for many years been currently
reported to have been among the straitest sect of the Montezuman faith,
and the belief is general that they were those who longest guarded the holy
fire in their estufas and looked to the east for the advent of their paraclete.
This is a traditional taradiddle which has no foundation in fact. Not
that Montezuma Ilhuicamina and Montezuma Xocoyotzin were not real
historical persons; nor that the latter, Montezuma II., was not euhemerized
and apotheosized; simply, that the Pecos people never worshiped him. The
myth recrudesced during the old Santa Fé trade, and was found in full swing
on our peaceable conquest of New Mexico in 1846. <i>Pecos</i> is corrupted from
the (Tañoan) Jemez word <i>Paquiu</i>, applied later than the aboriginal name
<i>Tshiquite</i>, rendered <i>Cicuique</i> in old Sp. chronicles. Pecos "was in 1540 the
largest Indian village or pueblo in New Mexico, containing a population of about
2,000 souls, which formed an independent tribe speaking the same language
as the Indians of Jemez. In 1680 the Pecos rebelled with the others, but surrendered
peaceably to Vargas in 1692, and thereafter remained loyal to Spain,"
Cent. Cyclop. Names, <i>s. v.</i> "What with the massacres of the second conquest,
and the inroads of the Comanches, they gradually dwindled away, till they found
themselves reduced to about a dozen, comprising all ages and sexes; and it
was only a few years ago that they abandoned the home of their fathers and
joined the Pueblo of Jemez," Gregg, Comm. Pra., I., 1844, p. 271. The
pueblo was desolate and in ruins when our Army of the West came by in 1846:
see Lieut. Emory's report, Ex. Doc. 41, 30th Congr., 1st Sess., pub. 1848, p.
30, with plate facing it; also, a different view, on the plate facing p. 447 of
Lieut. Abert's report in the same volume. The latter says, p. 446: "In the
afternoon [Sept. 26th, 1846] I went out on the hills to see the ancient cathedral
of Pecos. The old building and the town around it are fast crumbling away
under the hand of time. The old church is built in the same style as that of
San Miguel; the ends of the rafters are carved in imitation of a scroll; the
ground plan of the edifice is that of a cross. It is situated on a hill not far from
the winding course of the river. High ridges of mountains appear to converge
until they almost meet behind the town, and through a little gap one catches
sight of a magnificent range of distant peaks that seem to mingle with the sky."
Abert was told that the surviving remnant went to live with the Zuñis; but
Gregg's statement is no doubt correct, especially as Emory says, <i>l. c.</i>, that
"they abandoned the place and joined a tribe of the original race over the
mountains, about 60 miles south." The modern small village of Pecos grew
up close by the original site, which was abandoned in 1840.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-21" id="Footnote_IVP-21" href="#FNanchor_IVP-21"><span class="label">[IV'-21]</span></a> Here we enter the legendary land where we are liable to be soon confronted
with the standard specter of the northwest passage to India, and other well-dressed
phantoms. The body of water which the map shows probably represents
Utah l., south of Great Salt l., and connected therewith by the short
course of the Jordan. This seems to be what Pike means by the legend:
"This lake is known as high as the 40° of Lat. there it opens wider to the
West and receives the Waters of the Rio Yampancas"; for we can readily
understand this as a way of saying that the lake is connected with a larger
one to the W. Utah l. is meridionally E. of Great Salt l. by a few miles,
and entirely S. of it; the Jordan is a very short stream between them. In
a broad sense, then, Pike's Lac de Timpanagos or Lake of Tampanagos includes
both these bodies of water; and his Rio Yampancas answers to Bear r., the
large stream which falls into Great Salt l. at Bear River bay. His Sierra de
Tampanagos covers the mountains on the E. and S. E. of Great Salt l. A
different form of the same word appears in his "Indiens Yamparicas" of that
region, and yet another in the legend: "The Lake of Tampanagos is supposed
to be the same as the Lake of Thequaio in the Chart d'Alzate de Thequao placed
in 40° of Lat. some Historians pretend that the Aretiqui comes from this
Lake."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-22" id="Footnote_IVP-22" href="#FNanchor_IVP-22"><span class="label">[IV'-22]</span></a> <i>Chapetones</i> is a word which, with several variants in form, is pretty well
known, and to be found in many dictionaries, though its origin may never have
been satisfactorily shown, or at least agreed upon. In its application to un-American
Spaniards in America the sense implied seems to have been always
reproachful&mdash;perhaps something as our cowboys and other "rustlers" in the
wild and woolly West would speak of a "tenderfoot" or "greeny." In
Mexico the word corresponding to Chapeton or Chapetone was <i>Gachupin</i> or
<i>Gachupine</i>, "applied to natives of Spain who are called Chapetones in Peru
and Maturrangos in Buenos Aires," as one of the authorities before me says.
I am afraid that it is significant of some unpleasant matters already noted, to
find Pike here using the word said to be current in Peru, instead of that
which was usual in Mexico: see <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43774/43774-h/43774-h.htm#Page_XIX">Memoir</a>, <i>anteà</i>. Geo. W. Kendall's Narrative of
the Texan Expedition of 1841, 2 vols., small 8vo, London, 1845, II. p. 75, speaks
of "the <i>Gachupines</i>, or natives of Old Spain"; and p. 76: "the <i>Gachupines</i>
were indiscriminately slaughtered," etc. Gregg, Comm. Pra., I. 1844, p. 170,
has: "<i>Gachupin</i>&mdash;a term used to designate European Spaniards in America."
Wislizenus uses <i>Gachupins</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-23" id="Footnote_IVP-23" href="#FNanchor_IVP-23"><span class="label">[IV'-23]</span></a> That is, Rio San Francisco, one of the initial forks of the Gila: see the
map, and <a href="#Footnote_IVP-19">note<sup>19</sup></a>. The other is the main continuation of the Gila, sometimes
called Rio San Domingo. The confluence is in Arizona, a few miles over the
New Mexican border. There are mountains in this region called the San
Francisco divide, and others known as the San Francisco range&mdash;both by no means
to be confounded with the San Francisco mt. of the range in north-central Arizona.
Whether the ruins of which Pike speaks as on this river be the work of the
aboriginal colonists of Old Mexico from the northwest is, of course, in question;
he simply renders a prevalent opinion of his time. The oldest <i>authentic</i> ruins
known to exist in Arizona have only very recently been brought to light by the
exhumations conducted by my friend, Mr. Frank H. Cushing, of the Hemenway
Archæological Expedition, in 1886-88, in the valley of the Salado or Salt
r., near the town of Tempe, and not far from Ph&oelig;nix. An account of these
discoveries, from the pen of Dr. Washington Matthews, U. S. A., forms part
of the Seventh Memoir of Vol. VI. of Mem. Nat. Acad. Sci., 1893, pp. 142-161,
figs. 1-22. Mr. Cushing dug up mounds he supposes to be from 1,000
to 2,000 years old, full of bones and pottery, and revealing structures, some
of which recall the long famous Casa Grande itself. The buildings represented
by the cluster of mounds crowded an area some 6 m. long and ½ to 1 m.
wide. Five of the best marked mounds, standing in the places of groups of
houses, have been named Los Muertos, Los Guanacos, Los Hornos, Las Canopas,
and Las Acequias. Four kinds of architecture have been recognized as
priest-temples (style of Casa Grande); sun-temples, in some cases 200 feet long
by 150 broad; certain great communal houses, a sort of several-storied prototypes
of our modern city flats; and ultramural huts, jacals, or wickiups. I
should have called them respectively hier&oelig;cias, heli&oelig;cias, syn&oelig;cias, and
ex&oelig;cias. Those old Saladoans had an extensive system of irrigation, the lines
of acequias madres or mother-ditches alone representing over 150 m. of dug-way;
some of these canals are now utilized by the new-comers. It took many
thousand people many years to leave monuments like these. Their actual
antiquity is unknown; that it is very great is obvious; it is great enough to
have resulted in the disappearance of everything but bone and clay. There is
no sign of wood-work or textile fabric. Conjecture of a thousand years or more
may reasonably be based on comparison of the natural rate of decay of structures
known since the historic period, 1540. Thus, the Casa Grande has not changed
perceptibly in our day, except from vandalism, and probably looks much as it
did 350 years ago. It would appear also that the same indefatigable explorer
has settled the long-mooted question of the Seven Cities of Cibola (Cebola,
Sibola, Zibola), against any theory of their being the Moki (Tusayan) villages,
or being anywhere else than in the vicinity of Zuñi itself. The names which
have come down to us since Coronado, 1541, are: (1) Ahacus, Avicu, Aquico,
Jahuicu, Havico; (2) Canabe; (3) ...; (4) Aquinsa; (5) Alona; (6) Musaqui,
Maçaque, Maçaquia; (7) Caquina. According to a certain phonetic system
the preferable spelling is given as: (1) Hawiku; (2) Kyanawe; (3) Ketchupawe;
(4) Apina or Pinawan; (5) Halona; (6) Matsaki; (7) Kyakima. All
these were in what is now Valencia Co., N. M.; two were some miles S. W.
of Zuñi, near the village of Ojo Caliente; two were nearer Zuñi, but E. of it;
two were within 3 m. of Zuñi, S. of it; while one, Halona, occupied in part,
at least, the site of the present pueblo. The ruin of Hishota-uthla, classed as
"Cibolan" though not as one of the Seven Cities, is 12 m. N. E. of Zuñi, on
the road to Fort Wingate; excavation there has revealed "a compactly-built,
many-storied stronghold of stone containing a population of probably more than
a thousand people," supposed to have been dead and gone long before Coronado
passed that way. Zuñi, now one of the best known of all the extant
pueblos in New Mexico, is also the best living exemplar of such places. Its
antiquity is great, though hardly estimable with precision. Some of its inhabitants
made a tour of the United States under Mr. Cushing's management in
1881 and 1882. Immense collections of implements, utensils, and the like
were made about that time by the late Colonel James Stevenson, and deposited
in our museums. I visited the town in the summer of 1864, when it
was far from having been as well exploited as it has since become; so my own
observations are obsolete. The Zuñi nation, otherwise Çuni, Sune, Soone,
Suinyi, Shiwina, etc., sole member of the Zuñian linguistic stock, has but one
permanent pueblo, though it also inhabits at times three other small villages,
of the nature of "summer resorts," as we should say of our similar æstival
refuges. These Indians numbered 1,613 by the census of 1890. They are
well distinguished by their speech from all the various Tusayan, Tañoan, and
Keresan pueblonians of New Mexico, Arizona, and Chihuahua: for some of
which, see <a href="#Footnote_IVP-24">next note</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-24" id="Footnote_IVP-24" href="#FNanchor_IVP-24"><span class="label">[IV'-24]</span></a> I can find no better place than this to bring up some matters which require
attention concerning certain pueblos which Pike locates on his map, but
which, being off his route, he does not notice in his text. The Tañoan pueblos
have been pretty fully noted in the foregoing itinerary, but the Tusayan and
Keresan have not been sufficiently treated. We must first come to an understanding
of the term "Pueblo Indians." This is simply a convenient phrase,
or <i>façon de parler</i>, to designate various tribes which, in New and Old Mexico,
and Arizona, settled in permanent habitations, became attached to the soil,
practiced agriculture, kept flocks, and built the kind of towns called "pueblos."
They are thus collectively distinguished from all roving and more or less
warring tribes; they are settlers, not nomads; farmers and graziers rather than
hunters, and of peaceful rather than predatory proclivities. This step in the direction
of civilization was not however taken without some sacrifice of the strength of
the natural wild animal, and they have suffered in consequence. They are never
"bad" Indians; simply poor, tame ones, who for ages have been the prey of
the priest, the trader, and the wild Indian. But the point to be insisted on is,
that "Pueblo Indian" does not mean all one kind of Indians. It includes
various tribes of distinct ethnic characters, the representatives of several linguistic
lineages, who have severally yielded to their environments, and thus become
collectively modified in a way that brings about that appearance of affinity
which does not exist, and tends to obscure those radical distinctions of race
which do exist. We say, for instance, "New Yorker," meaning anyone who
lives in New York; but it would be as far from the fact to suppose that all
Pueblo Indians are of one race as that all New Yorkers are Americans. The
differences in language, and therefore in lineage, of the Tusayan, Keresan,
Tañoan, and Zuñian pueblonians is as great as that of the English, French,
German, and Spanish peoples. We must not be misled by the convenience of
a phrase: see <a href="#Footnote_IP-3">note<sup>3</sup>, p. 598</a>. The Pueblonians to be here noted belong either
(1) to the Tusayan federation, or (2) to the Keresan linguistic family.</p>

<p class="footnote">1. Pike marks, W. of the Continental divide and in the region of the Colorado
Chiquito, S. of the San Juan r., six Indian villages, which he calls Oraybe,
Mosanis, Songoapt, Gualpi, Chacat, and Cumpa. For the last two, see <a href="#Footnote_IP-21">note<sup>21</sup>,
p. 630</a>; the other four are the well-known Moki Indians, living on the four Moki
mesas, about 50 m. N. E. of the Colorado Chiquito, in N. E. Arizona. With
a single (Tañoan) exception, those Indians are of Shoshonean stock; and without
exception, they form the Tusayan confederacy. The ethnic affinities of Mokis are
with such Indians as the Snakes, Utes, Comanches, and other well-known members
of the Shoshonean race which overran so vast an area in western parts of the
United States. But these settled down in Arizona and built pueblos, isolated
from their kindred and surrounded by Athapascan (Navajo and Apache) tribes.
They are at present the only Shoshonean tribe in Arizona, excepting the handful
of Chemehuevis who live among Yuman tribes on the Colorado Grande,
and unless there be also a few Kwaiantikwokets on the northern border about
Mt. Navajo. The Mokis have resided in their present position for more than
200 years. This habitat is the plateau of moderate extent, commonly called the
Moki mesa, some special elevations of which are well-known landmarks by the
name of the Moki buttes, in full view from the main road which passes S. of
them. Three of the most conspicuous of these buttes are called Chimney,
Signal, and Spring. The mesa is between long. 110° and 111° W., in lat. 36°
N. and southward, and thus to the S. W. of the Navajos; the locality is sometimes
called the "Province of Tusayan." Here the Mokis proper, of Shoshonean
stock, built six villages; and a seventh village, probably also about 200
years old, called Hano (or Tewa) was built with them by Tañoan (Tewan or
Teguan) refugees from the Rio Grande. Thus even the compact and isolated
Moki establishment is not quite homogeneous, ethnically speaking. The
Tusayan census is about 2,000; the Tañoans there were lately counted as 132.
Among the names of the seven villages, the four which Pike gives can be recognized
under their modern spellings, as Oraybe=Oraibi, etc. One authority I
have consulted renders Oraibi, Shipauliwisi, Shongapavi, Mishongnivi, Shichoamavi,
Walpi (or Hualpee), and Tewa (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, Hano). Another, and probably
preferable set of orthographies, is Oraibi, Shupaulovi, Shumepovi, Mashongnavi,
Sichumovi, Walpi, and Hano. The name Tusayan, which varies to
Tuçayan, Tuzan, etc., is derived from a Zuñian word Usaya, applied to
certain pueblos once inhabited by the confederacy. The Tusayans' name of
themselves is a word variously rendered Hopituh, Hapitu, Hopee, Hopi, Opii,
etc. Other words designating them, or some of them, are Cinyumuh, Shenoma
or Shinumo, and Totonteac. The term now usually rendered Moki was
longest current as Moqui; it is also found as Maqui, Magui, Mohace, Mohotse,
and "Monkey."</p>

<p class="footnote">2. The Keresan family consists entirely of Pueblo tribes who live in New
Mexico along the Rio Grande and some of its tributaries, where their pueblos
are interspersed with others of Tañoan stock, in the moderate area to which
their range is thus restricted. The family name is variously rendered by different
authors, as Keres, Keran, Kera; Queres, Queris, Quera, Quirix; Chuchacas
or Chuchachas; also, Keswhawhay. Some ethnists divide these people
into two dialectal groups: one including the pueblos of Acoma and Laguna
and their outliers; the other, all the rest of the pueblos about to be named.
Acoma is the only pueblo which exists on the site occupied at the date of the
earliest Spanish annals. Laguna dates from 1699. There were five Keresan
pueblos in 1582; there had been seven in 1542. The full list of Keresan
pueblos, as given by Powell in alphabetical order, with the census for 1890, is:
1. Acoma, including the summer pueblitos of Acomita and Pueblita; pop. 566.
2. Cochití, on the W. bank of the Rio Grande, 27 m. S. W. of Santa Fé; pop.
268. "The inhabitants formerly successively occupied the Potrero de las
Vacas, the Potrero San Miguel, the now ruined pueblo of Cuapa, and the
Potrero Viejo," Cent. Cyc., <i>s. v.</i> 3. *Hasatch. 4. Laguna, including the eight
other places whose names are here starred; pop. 1,143. Laguna is thus really
a group of small pueblos situated on and near Rio San José, W. of the Rio
Grande. The original foundation was by Zuñians as well as by Keresans, and
the place was called Kawaiko. 5. *Paguate. 6. *Punyeestye. 7. *Punyekia.
8. *Pusityitcho. 9. San Felipe; pop. 554. This is called by the name of the
mission which the Spanish founded there. 10. Santa Ana, pop. 253, on the
Rio Jemez, W. of the Rio Grande. This Spanish name is also that of a
mission, usurping the native name Tamaya. 11. Santo Domingo; pop. 670.
12. *Seemunah. 13. Sia, on the Jemez; pop. 106; also called Chea, Chia,
Cia, Cilia, Silla, Tsea, Tsia, Tzia, Zia. "In 1582 Sia was said to be the
largest of five villages forming a province called Punames. The recent pueblo
dates from about 1692, when the village formerly occupied was abandoned.
The tribe, which was once comparatively populous, now numbers but 106.
The decrease is attributed largely to infectious disease and to the killing of
persons accused of witchcraft," Cent. Cyc., <i>s. v.</i> 14. *Wapuchuseamma. 15.
*Ziamma. Total pop. 3,560 for the 17 places, of which 15 (all but Acomita
and Pueblita) are permanent pueblos, and 7 are officially rated as principal and
distinct. Those which are given by Pike in his itinerary have been already
noted, along with the Tañoan pueblos as they occur in his text.</p>

three main divisions of the southern group of Athapascan Indians (the other
two being the Lipans and the Apaches). They have always lived, so far as is
known to history, in the country where they do now, and whence they raided
in every direction before their final subjugation in our times. They focused on
the upper waters of the Rio San Juan, in N. W. New Mexico, whence they
habitually ranged down the river in Colorado and Utah, and S. of it in
Arizona. They were thus in contact and conflict with Shoshonean tribes on
the N., and warred when they pleased with the various Apache tribes of
their own stock which were about them; they were of course a terror to the
peaceful Pueblonians, who had to hold their own as best they could against all
the battlesome savages by whom they were beset on every hand. They were
powerful, and are still one of the largest tribes with which we have to do, like
the Comanches and some of the divisions of the Sioux. A late census returns
about 17,000, nearly all on the large Navajo reservation which occupies the
contiguous N. W. corner of New Mexico and N. E. corner of Arizona.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-27" id="Footnote_IVP-27" href="#FNanchor_IVP-27"><span class="label">[IV'-27]</span></a> The Lipans or Sipans cut no figure now in the United States, where they
are practically extinguished, though the case may be different in Mexico. They
were a numerous and roving tribe of stalwart Indians who scoured the plains
of Texas from Red r. to the Rio Grande. They were a sort of Apaches,
having their nearest affinities with the latter, and in fact might be considered
the Apaches of the plains as distinguished from those of the mountains. They
have been commonly called Lipan Apaches, and such is no incorrect designation,
though they are rather more distinct from most bands of Apaches than
these are from one another. They extend in Mexico as far S. as Durango.
A Lipan collision which made some history, and enriched the cabinet of S. G.
Morton, the craniologist of Philadelphia, may be read in Hughes' Don. Exped.,
pp. 130-132, and Wislizenus, Mem., pp. 71, 72: see also <a href="#Footnote_IIIP-5">note<sup>5</sup>, p. 697</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-28" id="Footnote_IVP-28" href="#FNanchor_IVP-28"><span class="label">[IV'-28]</span></a> There is no historic period when the Apaches were not the scourge of the
country they inhabited, down to the time when they were brought to terms by
General Crook, in his Arizona campaigns of 1872 <i>seq.</i>, and even since then their
repeated escapades are matters of recent notoriety. They always warred with
other Indians, always warred with the whites, and not seldom with one another.
In Arizona particularly, so far as we are concerned, they did more to retard the
development of the country than all other causes combined. For some years
after the Territorial government was established, it was at the risk of life that
one went out of sight of Prescott or Fort Whipple alone or with a small party.
The Apaches lurked behind every rock, and hid in every bush; or, failing
that, under cover of every three blades of grass&mdash;a trick they did to perfection&mdash;and
reddened with blood every trail that led to the capital or the post. People
were killed and stock was run off within a few hundred paces of both these
places, and more than one pitched battle came off within ear-shot. A regular
part of my business for two years was the extraction of Apache arrow-heads.
The arrows used by the tribes nearest us were exactly such as Pike describes,
though, so far as my observation went, the heads were all of stone, quite small
and sharp, and very brittle, so that they usually shivered when they struck a
bone and the fragments were not easily removed. They were only held in
place with gum in the shallow notch at the end of the small hardwood stick
that was set in the large reed, and thus were always left in the wound when
the stick was pulled out. It is within my certain knowledge that they were in
some cases poisoned; the common opinion was that the septic substance was
derived from a deer's liver into which a rattlesnake had been made to inject
its venom, and which was then left to putrefy in the sun; but how this case
may really be, I never ascertained to my satisfaction. We continually hunted
Apaches and killed a good many; a particular friend of mine, Mr. Willard
Rice, who saved my life on a very ticklish occasion, when we were on a deer-hunt
together without other companions, and who is still living near Prescott,
is to be credited with at least 20 "good" (dead) Apaches&mdash;none of the score
women or children, either. But such desultory operations as we could conduct
in those years seemed to make little difference; it required Crook's systematic
campaigns, on a large scale, to render the country inhabitable. The other side
of the picture is, that the Apache has never committed an atrocity that we have
not exchanged in kind, with the sole exception that we have probably never put
a prisoner to death by slow torture, as was the Apache custom; that the Apache
has not broken faith with us oftener than we are proud to say we have with
him, and has not robbed us of more than we would like to take from him, if he
had anything left to steal and we had an opportunity. The secrets of Indian
agencies, like those of the Roman confessional, only leak out under great
pressure. The Apaches that troubled us most in that particular vicinity of
which I speak were known or supposed to be those of the Tonto basin, commonly
called Tontos (Pinal Coyoteros). In scientific classification the Apache
tribes and sub-tribes are numerous. The alphabetical list now recognized by
high authority is: Arivaipa, Chiricahua, Faraone, Gileño (Gilans, or Apaches
of the Gila, with four sub-tribes, Coyotero, Mimbreño, Mogollon, and Pinal
Coyotero or Tonto), Jicarilla, Lipan, Llanero, Mescalero, Naisha, Querecho,
Tchikun, Tchishi. All the Apaches within our jurisdiction have been brought
under military subjection and restraint. The largest body of Apaches is now
on the San Carlos reservation; their number is uncertain, say 2,000, representing
several different tribes. Nearly as many more are in charge of the military
at Camp Apache, in Arizona, say 1,900, known collectively as White Mountain
Apaches. About 800 Jicarillas are on the Southern Ute Reservations in Colorado;
some 500 Mescaleros are on the reservation of that name in New Mexico;
and 300 other Apaches are on the Kiowa, Comanche, and Wichita Reservation
in Indian Territory. After a recent outbreak had been quelled 356 prisoners
were sent to Mount Vernon Barracks in Alabama. There are about 150 children
at school in Carlisle, Pa. The total of perhaps 6,000 Apaches with which
we have still to deal is not large in comparison with the numbers of some other
tribes&mdash;but it is enough.</p>

1555, d. after 1611. "He was a son of the founder of Guadalajara, and was
married to a granddaughter of Hernando Cortés. In 1595 his proposition to
settle New Mexico was accepted by the viceroy Velasco, and after much delay
the grant was confirmed by the Count of Monterey. Oñate left Zacatecas in
Jan., 1598, with 130 men besides Indians, a large wagon- and cattle-train, etc.;
reached the Rio Grande, probably at El Paso, April 20; took formal possession
April 30; crossed the river; and in Aug. founded the first capital, San Juan
(Santa Fé was founded later). After the first year he had little trouble with the
Indians. Early in 1599 he explored a part of Arizona, and in 1604 followed the
Gila river down to the Gulf of California. He probably ceased to rule as governor

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-31" id="Footnote_IVP-31" href="#FNanchor_IVP-31"><span class="label">[IV'-31]</span></a> The province which Pike calls indifferently Biscay and New Biscay was
properly Nueva Vizcaya. It was named Reino de la Nueva Vizcaya by Francisco
de Ibarra, who invaded it about 1560-70, and retained the name until
after the independence. As a colonial division of New Spain it had been
originally called Copala, and was much more extensive than Pike's Biscay, as it
corresponded to the present states of Sonora, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Durango,
and a southern part of Coahuila. This region was included among the Provincias
Internas in 1777, and such was its status in Pike's time; but meanwhile
it had become contracted in extent by the exclusion of Sonora and Sinaloa, so
that in Pike's time it was little if any more than equivalent to the two present
states of Chihuahua and Durango. Present Chihuahua has Sinaloa and Durango
on the S. Present Durango is surrounded by Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Coahuila,
Zacatecas, and Jalisco.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-32" id="Footnote_IVP-32" href="#FNanchor_IVP-32"><span class="label">[IV'-32]</span></a> Wislizenus, Mem., p. 55, quotes this passage, and adds: "By rubbing the
hair of cats and dogs in the dark, I could elicit here a greater mass of electricity
than I had ever seen produced in this way. Some persons, entitled to confidence,
informed me that by changing their woollen under-dress in the night,
they had at first been repeatedly frightened by seeing themselves suddenly enveloped
in a mass of electrical fire. The remarkable flames that appeared after
a thunder-storm in the mountains south of El Paso, already mentioned by me
[Mem. p. 43], were no doubt connected with electricity. I recollect also, from
an account published in relation to the battle of Buena Vista, that during a
sultry evening electrical flames were seen on the points of the bayonets among
the sentinels stationed in the mountains."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-33" id="Footnote_IVP-33" href="#FNanchor_IVP-33"><span class="label">[IV'-33]</span></a> For these, see the itinerary, Apr. 30th-May 13th, <a href="#Page_668">pp. 668</a>-<a href="#Page_678">678</a>, and notes
there. The lakes Pike proceeds to mention are in or on the border of present
Coahuila. The situation of the Presidio del Norte, where the Conchos discharges,
is lat. 29° 33´ 53´´ N., long. 104° 36´ 27´´ W., by the river 346 m.
above the mouth of the Pecos, and 348 below El Paso&mdash;both of these distances
much in excess of the direct line between these points. "Batopilis" is very far
out for the source of the Conchos, unless Pike refers to some other place than
the modern Batopilas. This is situated below lat. 27° N., and in the Pacific
water-shed, being on a branch of the Rio del Fuerte, which runs from Chihuahua
through Sinaloa and empties into the Gulf of California at Point Ahome.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-34" id="Footnote_IVP-34" href="#FNanchor_IVP-34"><span class="label">[IV'-34]</span></a> Before undertaking to answer this query, it would be well to ascertain the
fact. The scorpions which Pike describes are known by the Spanish name
<i>alacran</i>, and I presume are closely related to the widely distributed <i>Androctonus
biaculeatus</i>, if not the same species. Kendall's Narrative of the Texan Expedition
of 1841, pub. Lond., 1845, II. p. 114, cites Pike in this connection, and
also has: "I believe that the city of Durango is somewhat celebrated for the
beauty and talent of its women&mdash;I know that it is noted for the numbers and
venomous qualities of its <i>alicrans</i>, or scorpions. Frequently, while travelling
through the State of Durango, were we regaled with Mexican stories of the
swarms of poisonous <i>alicrans</i> which infest the capital.... A bounty of some
three or six cents ... is paid by the authorities for each insect secured, and
according to some of the stories told us, no inconsiderable business is carried on
in catching and bottling the much dreaded scorpions." When Gregg was in
Durango, March, 1835, he noted that city "as being the headquarters, as it
were, of the whole scorpion family. During the spring, especially, so much are
the houses infested by these poisonous insects, that many people are obliged
to have resort to a kind of mosquito bar, in order to keep them out of their
beds at night. As an expedient to deliver the city from this terrible pest, a
society has already been formed, which pays a reward of a <i>cuartilla</i> (three cents)
for every <i>alacran</i> (or scorpion) that is brought to them. Stimulated by the
desire of gain, the idle boys of the city are always on the look-out; so that, in
the course of a year, immense numbers of this public enemy are captured and
slaughtered. The body of this insect is of the bulk and cast of a medium
spider, with a jointed tail one or two inches long, at the end of which is a
sting whose wounds are so poisonous as often to prove fatal to children, and are
very painful to adults. The most extraordinary peculiarity of these scorpions is,
that they are far less dangerous in the north than in the south, which in some
manner accounts for the story told Capt. Pike, that even those of Durango lose
most of their venom as soon as they are removed a few miles from the city," says
Gregg, very sensibly, Comm. Pra., II. 1844, p. 89. Hughes, Doniphan Exp.,
p. 128: "the soldiers would sometimes shake their blankets, toss ... the
lizards and <i>alacrans</i>, exclaiming angrily, 'd&mdash;&mdash;n the scorpion family!'"</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-35" id="Footnote_IVP-35" href="#FNanchor_IVP-35"><span class="label">[IV'-35]</span></a> Gregg, Comm. Pra., II. 1844, p. 114, cites Pike in his own description of
Chihuahua, as it appeared to him in 1839, and the two accounts may be here
brought together. Noting the regularity of the city in comparison with Santa
Fé, the dressing of the best buildings with hewn stone, the paving of some of
the streets, and the population of about 10,000, this author continues:</p>

<p class="footnote">"The most splendid edifice in Chihuahua is the principal church, which is
said to equal in architectural grandeur anything of the sort in the republic. The
steeples, of which there is one at each front corner, rise over 100 feet above the
azotea [roof]. They are composed of very fancifully-carved columns; and in
appropriate niches of the frontispiece, which is also an elaborate piece of sculpture,
are to be seen a number of statues, as large as life, the whole forming a
complete representation of Christ and the 12 Apostles. This church was
built about a century ago, by contributions levied upon the mines (particularly
those of Santa Eulalia, 15 or 20 miles from the city), which paid over a percentage
on all the metal extracted therefrom; a <i>medio</i> [6¼ cents], I believe,
being levied upon each <i>marco</i> of eight ounces. In this way, about a million of
dollars was raised and expended in some 30 years, the time employed in the
construction of the building. It is a curious fact, however, that, notwithstanding
the enormous sums of money expended in outward embellishments, there is
not a church from thence southward, perhaps, where the interior arrangements
bear such striking marks of poverty and neglect. If, however, we are not
dazzled by the sight of these costly decorations for which the churches of
Southern Mexico are so much celebrated, we have the satisfaction of knowing
that the turrets are well provided with bells, a fact of which every person who
visits Chihuahua very soon obtains auricular demonstration. One, in particular,
is so large and sonorous that it has frequently been heard, so I am informed, at
the distance of 25 miles.</p>

<p class="footnote">"A little below the <i>Plaza Mayor</i> stand the ruins (as they may be called) of
San Francisco&mdash;the mere skeleton of another great church of hewn stone, which
was commenced by the Jesuits previous to their expulsion in 1767, but never
finished. By the outlines still traceable amid the desolation which reigns
around, it would appear that the plan of this edifice was conceived in a spirit of
still greater magnificence than the Parroquia which I have been describing.
The abounding architectural treasures that are mouldering and ready to tumble
to the ground bear sufficient evidence that the mind which had directed its
progress was at once bold, vigorous, and comprehensive.</p>

<p class="footnote">"This dilapidated building has since been converted into a sort of state
prison, particularly for the incarceration of distinguished prisoners. It was
here that the principals of the famous Texan Santa Fé Expedition were confined,
when they passed through the place, on their way to the City of Mexico. This
edifice has also acquired considerable celebrity as having received within its
gloomy embraces several of the most distinguished patriots, who were taken
prisoners during the first infant struggles for Mexican independence. Among
these was the illustrious ecclesiastic, Don Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, who made
the first declaration at the village of Dolores, September 16, 1810. He was
taken prisoner in March, 1811, some time after his total defeat at Guadalaxara;
and being brought to Chihuahua, he was shot on the 30th of July following, in
a little square back of the prison, where a plain white monument of hewn stone
has been erected to his memory. It consists of an octagon base of about 25 feet
in diameter, upon which rises a square, unornamented pyramid to the height of
about 30 feet. The monument indeed is not an unapt emblem of the purity
and simplicity of the curate's character.</p>

<p class="footnote">"Among the few remarkable objects which attract the attention of the
traveller is a row of columns supporting a large number of stupendous arches
which may be seen from the heights, long before approaching the city from the
north. This is an aqueduct of considerable magnitude which conveys water from
the little river of Chihuahua, to an eminence above the town, whence it is passed
through a succession of pipes to the main public square, where it empties itself
into a large stone cistern; and by this method the city is supplied with water.
This and other public works to be met with in Chihuahua, and in the southern
cities, are glorious remnants of the prosperous times of the Spanish empire. No
improvements on so exalted a scale have ever been made under the republican
government.... <i>¡Ojalá por los dias felices del Rey!</i>"</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-36" id="Footnote_IVP-36" href="#FNanchor_IVP-36"><span class="label">[IV'-36]</span></a> Sonora then was nearly the same as the present State of that name, but lost
a northern strip (the Gadsden Purchase) to our Arizona, and also lost its New
Mexican line. For the present boundary between it and the United States,
running on lat. 31° 20´ N. to long. 111° W., see <a href="#Footnote_IP-32">note<sup>32</sup>, p. 645</a>. In Mexico,
Sonora is now bounded on the E. by Chihuahua, on the S. by Sinaloa, and on
the W. by the Gulf of California, except the short extent to which the Colorado
r. separates it from Lower California. Area, 77,550 sq. m.; pop. 140,500;
capital, Hermosillo, pop. 7,000; principal seaport, Guaymas, pop. 5,500, situated
in lat. 27° 56´ N., long. 110° 36´ W.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-37" id="Footnote_IVP-37" href="#FNanchor_IVP-37"><span class="label">[IV'-37]</span></a> The whole Sonoran water-shed is Pacific, and the river-system runs on
general S. and S. W. courses to the Gulf, in a series of somewhat parallel
streams. The northernmost one of these, of any size, which Pike calls Ascencion
r., I find lettered Rio Altar; its main branch is Rio Magdalena; some of
its ultimate sources are in Arizona, in the country about Arivaca, Tubac, and
old Fort Mason; it discharges between George's bay and Cape Tepoca. The
Sonora is much larger, with a main branch called San Miguel; it discharges
opposite Tiburon isl. Arizpa, which Pike speaks of as near the head of the
Yaqui, is high up on the right bank of the Sonora; lower down is Hermosillo
(lat. 29° 10´ N., long. 110° 45´ W.). The Yaqui is the largest Sonoran
river, falling into the Gulf below Guaymas and above Point Lobos. It has
two main forks, Rio Moctezuma and Rio Bavispe. Rio Matape, a small river,
is the one that falls in at Guaymas, and not the Yaqui. Another small one,
Rio Mayo, falls in below Vacamora and Point Rosa. Rio Alamos, which
heads in Sonora, falls over the Sinaloan boundary.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-38" id="Footnote_IVP-38" href="#FNanchor_IVP-38"><span class="label">[IV'-38]</span></a> Arizpe is now a small place, with a population of probably 4,000, and is of
interest chiefly to the antiquarian. The original mission of Arizpe was already
over 150 years old in Pike's time, and the place is believed to have been an
Opata village as early as 1540. The derivation of the name is given as the
Opata word <i>arit</i>, meaning "ant." The name <i>Arizpe</i> suggests the obvious conjecture,
that the root of the word <i>Arizona</i>, the derivation of which has been so
much mooted, may be here found. How this may be, I do not know; but
<i>Arizona</i> does not appear to be Spanish, and certainly any such etymology as
Lat. <i>arida zona</i>, which has been adduced among others, is fictitious.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-39" id="Footnote_IVP-39" href="#FNanchor_IVP-39"><span class="label">[IV'-39]</span></a> Tubson is now Tucson, Ariz. San Cruz is Santa Cruz, also in Arizona,
on or near the branch of the Gila of that name. Tubac is likewise now Arizonian,
being a place about on long. 111° W., N. W. of Nogales, and not far
from old Forts Mason and Crittenden. Altac is Altar, on the Sonoran river
of that name. "Fiuntenas" I take to be a misprint for Fronteras, a place on
one of the headwaters of the Yaqui, about lat. 31° N. Bacuachi is on one of
the branches of the Sonora r., above Arizpe. Bavista is Bavispe, a place high
up on the river of that name, close to the eastern border of the State. Horcasites,
to judge from its location on Pike's map, was on or near the Sonora r.,
in the vicinity of present Ures; but I have not found the place. Near it
Pike locates a Presidio San Antonio, omitted from the text. Buenavista is a
place low down on the Yaqui r.; the present road from Punta de Agua on Rio
Matape goes through it to Batacoso, Alamos, and so on.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-40" id="Footnote_IVP-40" href="#FNanchor_IVP-40"><span class="label">[IV'-40]</span></a> Sinaloa or Cinaloa is practically the same as it was, but would be now
said to be bounded by Sonora, Chihuahua, Durango, and Jalisco; its whole S.
W. length is sea-coast, on the Gulf of California and Pacific Ocean. Area,
36,180 sq. m.; pop. 245,700; capital, Culiacan, on the river of that name,
in lat. 24° 50´ N., long. 107° 20´ W.; pop. 8,000. The principal city and
port is Mazatlan, in lat. 23° 15´ 36´´ N.; pop. 12,000.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-41" id="Footnote_IVP-41" href="#FNanchor_IVP-41"><span class="label">[IV'-41]</span></a> Sinaloa has a long series of comparatively short rivers, with a general
S. W. trend to the sea. Rio del Fuerte (River of the Fort) is the largest and,
excepting Rio Alamos, the northernmost. The Sinaloa is the next one of
any size; on this is Sinaloa, in Pike's time the capital, but not now a place
of special importance. Further S. come successively, Rio San Lorenzo,
Rio San Miguel, Rio Piaxtla, Rio Mazatlan, and Rio El Rosario; the latter is
charted by Pike, who empties it into the Gulf, near 23°, which is about right.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-42" id="Footnote_IVP-42" href="#FNanchor_IVP-42"><span class="label">[IV'-42]</span></a> Coahuila, or Coahuila de Zaragoza, or Cohahuilla, or Quagila, etc., has
much the same limits now, excepting of course the cis-Grandean portion which
is now a part of Texas. On the eastern side there is a curious peninsula or panhandle
of the State, which is wedged between two similar projections of Nuevo
Leon and Tamaulipas respectively. On the S. are San Luis Potosí as well as
Zacatecas, and on the W. the former Biscay gives Chihuahua and Durango.
Area, 60,500 sq. m.; pop. 178,000; capital, Saltillo, about lat. 25° 25´ N.,
long. 101° 4´ W., founded 1586; pop. 23,000.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-43" id="Footnote_IVP-43" href="#FNanchor_IVP-43"><span class="label">[IV'-43]</span></a> The Rio Grande does not now cross Coahuila, but forms its whole U. S.
border on the N. W., N., and N. E. But there are a good many rivers in Coahuila,
some of them notable. 1. Prominent among these is the whole course of
the Sabinas, and of its main fork on which is Monclova, together with their
respective tributaries, down to where the two are joined, to continue under the
name of Rio Salado to the Rio Grande; the Salado cuts across the tip end of
New Leon, but again becomes Coahuilan to the extent of separating Coahuila
from Nuevo Leon before entering Tamaulipas. The "Aqua Verde" lake
which Pike names, and which is rather centrally than westerly located, is the
Laguna de Agua Verde; which, with a neighboring one called Santa Maria,
belongs to the water-system of the Sabinas. 2. The two rivers which flow into
Lag. del Muerto and Lag. de Parras enter Coahuila. 3. The headwaters of the
Rio San Juan, on one of which Saltillo, the capital, is situated, are in Coahuila.
4. A series of Coahuilan streams falls into the Rio Grande at successive points
from below Presidio Salto to above Presidio San Vincento.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-44" id="Footnote_IVP-44" href="#FNanchor_IVP-44"><span class="label">[IV'-44]</span></a> The tree is not the palmetto of the Southern States, <i>Sabal palmetto</i>, but one
of the large woody yuccas, of the same genus as the small shrubby ones commonly
called Spanish bayonets, from the character of the leaves Pike notes.
<i>Yucca treculeana</i> (or <i>canaliculata</i>) is a Mexican species sometimes 25 feet high
and 2 feet thick, thus answering to the requirements of the text. The one best
known in our country is the tree yucca, <i>Yucca arborescens</i>, very similar to the last
named. This grows abundantly in some parts of Southern California in the
valley of the Mohave r., sometimes so thickly as to make a sort of forest. Multitudes
may be seen along the line of the Atl. and Pac. R. R. in the desert,
where there is for many miles no sign of anything else that looks like a tree.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IVP-46" id="Footnote_IVP-46" href="#FNanchor_IVP-46"><span class="label">[IV'-46]</span></a> Robert Cavelier, Le Sieur de la Salle, b. Rouen, Normandie, France,
Nov. 22d, 1643, murdered by Duhaut in conspiracy with other assassins, in
Texas, on a branch of the Trinity, or of the Brazos, Mar. 19th or 20th, 1687,
was never at the mouth of the Rio Grande. La Salle sailed from France with
four vessels and about 280 persons, July 24th, 1684; three of the vessels sighted
Florida Jan. 15th, 1685; landed at St. Louis, later St. Bernard, now Matagorda,
bay, in Feb., 1685; one vessel sailed away in Mar., 1685, leaving La
Salle with about 180 adventurers or colonists. He founded Fort St. Louis at
or near present La Vaca, in Apr., 1685, giving a color of French claim that did
not entirely fade away till 1803, though the settlement speedily aborted. The
remainder of 1685 and the year 1686 were mainly passed in fruitless wanderings
and warrings in different directions, with misery and disaster at every turn. La
Salle's people dwindled down to about 20 who were left at the fort, and 17 who
started with their leader, Jan. 7th, 1687, overland to Canada. This <i>verloren
hoop</i> included: La Salle; Father Jean Cavelier, his brother; their two nephews,
Moranget and Cavelier; Sieur de Maria, Friar Anastase Douay, who afterward
wrote of the journey, a witness of La Salle's death; Joutel, a trusty soldier,
whose account (pub. 1713) is to be preferred to Douay's when the two differ;
Teissier, a pilot, one of the conspirators; Liotot, the surgeon, ditto; Hiens,
a German ex-buccanier, ditto; Duhaut, the actual assassin; Jean Archevêque,
his servant and accomplice; Saget, La Salle's servant; Nika, a Shawanoe
hunter; another Indian, and some other persons. This party had crossed the
Colorado and Brazos Mar. 15th, 1687. After a quarrel which arose over some
buffalo meat, in a detached party who were 6 m. away from La Salle, Duhaut,
Liotot, Hiens, and others conspired to kill Moranget; Liotot brained him;
Saget and Nika were also then and there killed. La Salle left Joutel and others
in their own camp and proceeded to the scene of this tragedy, accompanied only
by Father Douay, and an Indian, Mar. 19th or 20th. On his approach,
Duhaut shot him in the head from ambush; Liotot and others mocked and
buffeted his corpse. Some time in May Duhaut was murdered by Hiens; at
the same time Liotot was murdered by one Ruter. Some survivors of this
bloody expedition reached Poste aux Arkansas in July. The colony left at
Fort St. Louis had been utterly extirpated by Indian massacre and dispersion
of the few survivors, before Apr. 22d, 1689, when the spot, void of all but the
dead there buried, was visited by a Spanish party under Don Alonzo de Leon.

with the map, and with the misapprehension under which Pike labored. As
already indicated, <a href="#Footnote_IIIP-18">note<sup>18</sup>, p. 710</a>, the three are branches of one, which falls into
the Gulf in the same bay with the Sabine; but Pike cuts off the Nachez and
Angelina from the Toyac and turns them into the Trinity as branches of the
latter, thus leaving the Toyac alone to pursue the course all three should have
taken together.</p>

manner perhaps traceable back to the Moors, or to the wives of the prophet
himself, is as indispensable an article of attire as a fan. The Spaniards have a
phrase <i>de reboso</i>, equivalent to the Italian <i>in petto</i>, Latin <i>sub rosa</i>, to indicate
secrecy, intrigue, and the like. The reboso varies much in size, shape, color,
texture, price, and other qualities; and, according to one distinguished author,
it has various uses: "The church was crowded with women of all conditions,
and the horrid <i>reboso</i>, which the poor use for shawl, bonnet, handkerchief, and
spit-box, sent out an odor which the incense from the altar failed to stifle,"
says Emory, Ex. Doc. 41, 30th Cong., 1st Sess., 1848, p. 41. Some say that
the large mobile lips of Mexican señoras acquire their osculatory capacity by the
habitual use of those features in gesticulation as well as articulation; their hands
and arms being kept bundled up with their heads in that comprehensive article
of attire, they are obliged to use their lips for pointers.</p>

According to this author the mint of Mexico coins every year 50 millions of

annually printed by order of the Court, and published in the Political Essay

together in no intelligible or imaginable order. There being no evidence of
design or purpose, the first step toward bringing an appearance of order out of
this confusion must be taken by disregarding the original helter-skelter entirely,
and by rearranging the various pieces of which this Appendix consisted as freely
as if they were loose manuscripts accidentally disordered. The documents with
which we have to do were disarranged as follows:</p>

<p class="footnote">No. 1. Pike's Observations on New Spain, the leading article, not numbered,
making pp. 1-51, or more than half of the whole Appendix. (This I have disposed
of in the foregoing <a href="#Page_718">Chap. IV</a>.)</p>

<p class="footnote">No. 2, pp. 52, 53. A fragmentary vocabulary of Mississippi place-names,
having no connection with Pt. 3 of the book. (This I have made Chap. IX.,
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43774/43774-h/43774-h.htm#Page_355">pp. 355</a>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43774/43774-h/43774-h.htm#Page_356">356</a>, of Pt. 1, where it belongs.)</p>

<p class="footnote">No. 3, pp. 53-55. A letter from Pike to Wilkinson.</p>

<p class="footnote">No. 4, pp. 55-57. A letter from Wilkinson to Pike.</p>

<p class="footnote">No. 5, pp. 57-63. A letter from Pike to Wilkinson.</p>

<p class="footnote">No. 6, pp. 64-68. A Congressional report, with accompanying documents,
including matter relating to all three of Pike's expeditions, yet lacking one of
the most important of the papers belonging to it (see No. 13, below). (All
these I shall relegate to the following <a href="#Page_840">Chap. VI</a>.)</p>

<p class="footnote">No. 7, p. 69. A mere paragraph about a priest. (This I have simply interpolated
in the text of the itinerary, Chap. II., <a href="#Page_603">pp. 603</a>, <a href="#Page_604">604</a>&mdash;the place where it
belongs.)</p>

<p class="footnote">No. 8, pp. 69, 70. A letter from Pike to Allencaster.</p>

<p class="footnote">No. 9, p. 70. A certificate from Allencaster to Pike.</p>

<p class="footnote">No. 10, p. 71. A letter from Pike to Allencaster.</p>

<p class="footnote">No. 12, p. 72. A letter from Salcedo to Pike.</p>

<p class="footnote">No. 13, pp. 73-77. The missing document which belongs to No. 6 (see
above), being a brief sketch of Pike's Arkansaw Expedition and of his Mexican
Tour, no date, no place, no addressee. (This, of course, goes with No. 6, in
the following <a href="#Page_840">Chap. VI</a>.)</p>

<p class="footnote">No. 14, pp. 78, 79. A letter from Pike to Salcedo.</p>

<p class="footnote">No. 16, pp. 80-82. Inventory of papers seized by the Spanish authorities,
with accompanying certificate.</p>

<p class="footnote">No. 18, pp. 83-85. A letter from Pike to Salcedo.</p>

<p class="footnote">No. 19, pp. 86, 87. A letter from Salcedo to Wilkinson.</p>

<p class="footnote">By eliminating from the above No. 1, No. 2, No. 6, No. 7, and No. 13, as
above indicated, the residuum consists entirely of correspondence relating to the
Mexican Tour, which is easily rearranged in the chronological order of the
several letters, and thus forms the present <a href="#Page_807">Chapter V</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VP-2" id="Footnote_VP-2" href="#FNanchor_VP-2"><span class="label">[V'-2]</span></a> On this subject I can throw a little further light, as reflected from some
documents which I find on file in the Archives of the War Department. The
following letter is in a clerk's hand, with Pike's signature:</p>

<p class="footnotel45"><span class="smcap">Washington city</span> Feby. 10<sup>th</sup>. 1808.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="footnote">Being informed that the Chevalier Don Fownda, Charge des affaires from his
Catholic Majesty to the United States, has forwarded to your office an account
of expenses said to have occurred in consequence of my being <i>obliged</i> to pass
thro' the internal provinces of New Spain, amounting to a sum, exceeding 21,000
Dollars.&mdash;I have thought it proper to state to you the following circumstances.
On my being informed by the Gov<sup>r</sup>. at Santa fé that I should be obliged to go
to Chihuahua, I addressed a letter to him in which amongst other topics&mdash;I demanded
to be advised if myself and troops were to be supported at the expense
of the U States or his Catholic majesty&mdash;On this subject he was silent in his
reply&mdash;but the day I marched from that city sent me a small sum of money,
which I was informed was the subsistence money of my party to Chihuahua&mdash;at
which place I refunded said sum to an officer of the Gov<sup>rs</sup>. acquaintance &amp;
took his receipt for the same&mdash;at the seat of goverment I received $1000 and
gave triplicate receipts making my goverment responsible for the same&mdash;and on
the close of my correspondence with Gen<sup>l</sup>. Salcedo was informed that I should
be conveyed to our territories in the same manner I had been from New Mexico
to Chihuahua&mdash;That was to find our own subsistence&mdash;but all other expences
to be paid by the Spanish officers.&mdash;I left a requisition that my party in the rear
might be allowed $2<sup>6¼</sup>/<span class="s08">100</span> per diem for their subsistence, and as this was for the
support of our troops, when in their country, it remains to be decided by
our Gov<sup>t</sup>, whether they will refund the money&mdash;At the first place where I
changed my escort on this side of Chihuahua, pay was demanded for the services
of the mules, and horses, which I positively refused&mdash;but finding the officer was
embarassed, I gave him a receipt agreable to the enclosed copy and date.&mdash;at
S<sup>t</sup>. Antonio I received $200 of Gov<sub>r</sub>. Cordero&mdash;whereof the account stands enclosed&mdash;but
I presume in justice no part should be allowed except the cash
advanced, and the mens subsistence&mdash;as agreable to the Chevaliers own maxim&mdash;"<i>the

to defray them</i>"&mdash;.</p>

of the State Department:</p>

or Bowwood r., meaning the Osage. The reference is to the bois d'arc
or bowwood, the Osage orange, <i>Maclura aurantiaca</i>, a well-known tree of the
lower Mississippi valley, whose wood was formerly in great request for the purpose
indicated in the vernacular name. It is very thorny, bears pruning well,
and has come to be much cultivated for hedges. Its botanical affinities are with
the mulberry.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VP-4" id="Footnote_VP-4" href="#FNanchor_VP-4"><span class="label">[V'-4]</span></a> The meaning of the clause is clear, though it may not be obvious on its face,
owing to the use of "summoning" in a particular sense: compare Pike's use of
"summons" in <a href="#Page_825">Art. 11, p. 825</a>. Agreeably with etymology, "summoning"
might be written <i>submonition</i>, on the model of <i>admonition</i>; the radical meaning
of these two words is much the same, both conveying the idea of warning,
with the implied force of enjoining, restraining, etc. Salcedo simply reminds
Wilkinson that the Spanish government had warned the United States off those
premises, and consequently that the latter should not have carried into effect any
projects of, etc.</p>

Army, became a captain of the 2d Infantry, Mar. 4th, 1791; he was arranged
to the second sub-Legion Sept. 4th, 1792; promoted to be a major in the first
sub-Legion Mar. 3d, 1793, and assigned to the 1st Infantry Nov. 1st, 1796; he
acted as inspector of the army from Feb. 27th, 1797, to May 22d, 1798, and
became lieutenant-colonel of the 2d Infantry April 1st, 1802; he acted as
adjutant and inspector-general from Mar. 26th, 1802, to May 9th, 1807, was
promoted to the colonelcy of the 2d Infantry Sept. 7th, 1805, to a brigadier-generalship
July 2d, 1812, and honorably discharged June 15th, 1815; he died
Oct. 19th, 1822.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VP-7" id="Footnote_VP-7" href="#FNanchor_VP-7"><span class="label">[V'-7]</span></a> It will be observed that Pike's syntax leaves the personal pronoun equivocal.
We naturally read that Sergeant Meek killed one of his own men, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, a man
of Pike's party; and I have been more than once summonsed, during my editorial
function, to say who this man was. But there is no record that I can discover,
and no other intimation than the above ambiguous clause, that any man of Pike's
or Meek's party was killed by Meek. On the contrary, Pike's final word about
his men accounts for every one of them: see <a href="#Page_855">p. 855</a>, and note there. In the
absence of any further evidence, we must understand that Sergeant Meek killed
one of General Salcedo's men; and if so, might easily be accused of "great
intractability."</p>

with F. <i>capot</i>, meaning hood. Among the Canadian voyageurs and
other French in America, <i>capote</i> was the most general name of any such outer
garment. It constantly occurs, for example, in annals of the fur-trade of the
Northwest, capotes being made of several regulation sizes and styles, for barter
with the Indians, as well as for wear of the men of the N. W. Company.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VIP-1" id="Footnote_VIP-1" href="#FNanchor_VIP-1"><span class="label">[VI'-1]</span></a> This chapter, which appears to be a number of disjointed pieces, whose
connection is not obvious, is really all of a part, being a certain Congressional
matter. It is easily traced to its source in American State Papers, as the set
of documents which Pike brought to bear on Congress for legislative action in
his case, when he was trying to secure some appropriation to recompense himself
and his companions for what they had undergone and accomplished during
his two expeditions. Barring the way in which it was botched in this book, Nos.
6 and 13 are substantially the same as Doc. No. 259 of the 2d Session of the 10th
Congress, being the report of a committee laid before the Ho. Reps. Dec. 16th,
1808, with accompanying papers, and as such will be found printed in American
State Papers, folio, Washington, Gales and Seaton, 1834, pp. 942-944. The
same volume contains, on p. 719, Doc. No. 248 of the 1st Session of the 10th
Congress, being a previous report of a committee, communicated by John
Montgomery, chairman, to the Ho. Reps., Mar. 10th, 1808. The same volume
also contains, on p. 463, Doc. No. 212 of the 2d Session of the 9th Congress, a
Report on Exploration of Western Waters, communicated by Mr. Alston to the
Ho. Reps., Dec. 22d, 1806, mentioning Lewis and Clark, Pike, and Freeman,
and recommending an annual appropriation for the purpose of such explorations.
But none of these bills passed or became a law, though in Pike's own
case they were, as we see, entirely favorable to his claim for extra remuneration.
The case was reopened by Pike's widow, many years after his death;
but nothing ever came of it. This seems hard, especially as Lewis and Clark
and their men were well rewarded by Congressional legislation; but acts of Congress
are as inscrutable as the ways of Providence, in any question of right or
wrong. As to the composition of this chapter, see <a href="#Footnote_IVP-1">note<sup>1</sup>, p. 807</a>, and observe
that we have: (1) The Report of the Congressional Committee of which Mr.
Montgomery was chairman, recommending an appropriation. (2) A letter
from the Secretary of War to this chairman, inclosing copies of instructions
Pike received from Wilkinson for each of his expeditions. (3) A copy of
<i>one</i> of these instructions, namely, for the Mississippi voyage, but no copy of
the other which ought to appear here&mdash;for the reason, no doubt, that Pike had
put it already in his book, as a sort of preface to Pt. 2: see <a href="#Footnote_VI-1">note<sup>1</sup>, p. 562</a>.
Both or neither of these instructions should have come here. (4) Dearborn's
complimentary letter to Pike. (5) Pike's return of men, etc., or roster of his
two parties, furnished for the information of Congress upon the question of
who were the persons for whom reward was claimed.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VIP-2" id="Footnote_VIP-2" href="#FNanchor_VIP-2"><span class="label">[VI'-2]</span></a> This roster is at variance with that given in the itinerary, <a href="#Page_358">p. 358</a>, where it
stands one lieutenant (Wilkinson), one doctor (Robinson, who was the volunteer),
two sergeants (Ballenger and Meek), one corporal (Jackson), 16 privates
(Boley, Bradley, Brown, Carter, Dougherty, Gorden, Huddleston, Kennerman,
Menaugh, Miller, Mountjoy, Roy, Smith, Sparks, Stoute, Wilson), and one
interpreter (Vasquez). Compare <a href="#Footnote_I-2">note<sup>2</sup>, pp. 358-360</a>, and <a href="#Footnote_III-50">note<sup>50</sup>, p. 510</a>.
Numerous other slips in this sketch, notably of dates, indicate that it was
written from memory.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VIP-3" id="Footnote_VIP-3" href="#FNanchor_VIP-3"><span class="label">[VI'-3]</span></a> It appears from Lieutenant Wilkinson's own report that he had but five men
with him, the sergeant and four privates. Pike's enumeration of "six men"
besides the sergeant includes the two Osages, whom he thus counts twice, to an
aggregate of nine persons.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VIP-4" id="Footnote_VIP-4" href="#FNanchor_VIP-4"><span class="label">[VI'-4]</span></a> As a pendent to the foregoing sketch, which was prepared for the information
of Congress, may be presented a hitherto unpublished letter which Pike
wrote to the Secretary of War soon after his arrival in Washington, when he
transmitted reports of his Western Expedition. It is printed literally and
punctually true to the manuscript now on file in the archives of the War Department.</p>

<p class="footnote">I am at length enabled to present you with the reports of my late expidition
from the period of our sailing from Belle Fontain on the 15<sup>th</sup>. of July 1806; to
my leaveing my Stockade on the Rio del Norte under escort of the Spanish Cavalry;
on the 27. Feby. 07.</p>

<p class="footnote">They should have been presented some time since, had I not have been
imployed by the Commander in Chief, for a very consedrable proportion of my
time since my arrival at the seate of Goverment:&mdash;It must be recollected that
the Spanish General seized on all my Documents in his power; Amongst which
[were] the book of Charts protracted, daily, from my notes and the eye; and
although I retained a Copy of Courses, Distances, &amp;c&mdash;by which I have been
enabled to retrace my plans, and routes, yet they necessarily are not so perfect
as the Original and daily protractions would have made them: They likewise
obtained, and retained a note book engrossed with Observations on the manners,
morals, and habits of the Aborigines of the countries through which we passed;
the loss of which naturally abridged my desertation on those heads; also all my
Meteorological tables to the entrance of their country where [were] amongst
the papers sized [seized]: But what I regret the most was my Astronomical
Observations having taken at Several of the most important points, the necessary
Data, from which on my arrival at the United States, and having it in my
power to refer to the appropriate tables and Calculations, I could have fixed the
Latt. and Longitude and thereby secured the Great Geographical Object of giving
a Determinate position to Various and important points of our Country,
from having it in my power to correct the Chart which I now present you
agreeably to the true principals of spherical projections. The few notes you see
of the Latt. are ascertained from letters I wrote Gen<sup>l</sup>. Wilkinson at different
periods and the Longitude would have been preserved in the same manner had
I have had tables with me which would have enabled me to calculate the immersions
&amp; emersions;&mdash;as well as angular distances at the time the observations
were taken.&mdash;In the Chart herewith I have included all the Country between
the La Platte of the Missouri and the Red river of the Mississsippi; and
although it is, and from the nature of our information, of that immense district
<i>must be</i>, very imperfect; yet I do not hesitate to assert it is the best
extant: I have carefully remarkd on said Chart all the parts by actual survey
and the Gentleman by whom surveyed, in order that each may lay claim
to his proper proportion of fame.&mdash;You have also herewith L<sup>t</sup>. Wilkinsons
report of his expedition after I detached him down the Arkensaw, (and his
seperate Chart on a large scale), in which he encountered immense dificulties in
the accomplishment of the desired end.</p>

but had I have possessed them; the various duties I was oblidged to perform of
commanding Officer, Surveyor; Astronomer; hunter; and advanced guard, together
with the dreary season in which we travelled part of the route; with our
minds much more actively employed in forming resources for our preservation
from famine; and defence against any savage enemy who might assail us, then
[than] examining the productions of Nature which was under our feet and
Instead of our eyes being directed to the Ground; they were endeavouring to
peace [pierce] the Wild before us&mdash;or giveing distinction and form to moveing
Bodies on the distant Prairies&mdash;or enjoying the rapturous sublimity of the unbounded
prospects which were frequently presented to our View's. Yet Doc<sup>r</sup>.
Robinson who possessed both talents, and taste for those pursuits; has promised
to enclose me some remarks which no doubt will be interesting; and if received
shall be presented to the War Department.</p>

<p class="footnote">After I entered the Spanish Dominions I was as careful to conceal any notes
or observations, I made on their country as I had been indifferent to all that
related to what was in the conceived Territories of the United States; Trusting
to the dignified title of an American Officer; the Caution with which I conceived
the Spanish Goverment would act and an Idea I had eroneously formed
of their want of Energy; yet owing to some Indications I was induced to conceal
my journal and other papers, leaving the Book of Charts &amp;c for to lull any
suspicions which might arise from their being no papers in the trunks. I now
wish General Dearborne to signify to me the extent he wishes me to enter in
the of my involuntary Tour through the Internal Provences of New Spain if it
is thought proper: I can give (from the Notes and Documents in my possession)
in addition to <i>my Diary and Corrispondences with the Spanish Governors
relative to my Detention, seizure of my papers, the subsistence of my party &amp;c</i>;
A General Idea of the Commerce, morals, manners, Arts, and Sciences: A
correct account of their Military posts, with a well founded estimate of the
whole Militia of the Provences; their population, and relative connexion with
each other. Also, an Idea of their Annual revenue, the monies coined at the
mint &amp;c. Some suggestions on the sate [state] and influence of the Catholc
Religion, The Dispositions of the Inferior Clergy&mdash;to close whole with a view
of the general tendency of the Country to a revolution, the interests of the
United States in case of that event; or the best mode of Treating with New
Spain in case of a rupture with the Mother Country; with a General Chart of
those parts of the provinces through which we passed. This may be takeing to
wide a field for the time, the Goverment may wish to allow me in making the
report; or they may possess, information on those subjects from pens far abler
than mine, who may have anticepated those suggestions in their full extent.</p>

<p class="footnote">I beg leave at this moment to call the attention of the Secy of War to the situation
of the remaining part of my Detachment in New Spain which consists of
one Interpreter, a Young man of Good family in upper Louisiania whose salary
is 500 Dollars pr&mdash;Annum, one Sergeant, one Corporal and five privates; several
of those poor fellows have become cripples from their limbs being frozen,
and are in a strange country amongst people whose language they cannot understand,
from their long detention without any information from their native
Land, dispair will seize their minds, and will picture to their immaginations
Years of Confinement in a foreign Country&mdash;I who was late their Companion
in dificulties and Dangers cannot so soon forget our forlorne situation, and the
obligations I am under to them for the promtitude with which they encountered
danger, and fortitude they exhibited, and the fidility and attachment they
evinced to their Military Commander, and leader, through those scenes; as not
to exert myself to call forth the attention of the Government in their favour: I
therefore hope that General Dearborne will take such measures as may be
deemed expediant in order to restore those poor Lads to the service of their
Country.</p>

of those who accompanied Pike from the Rio Conejos into Mexico, and
there is no evidence that he was dropped anywhere in that country.
Also, Pike says that only "five" privates were detained in Mexico when
he made a report to the Secretary of War, dated at Washington, Jan.
26th, 1808: see <a href="#Page_853">p. 853</a>. Furthermore, witness the following hitherto
